 VERSION LOG:
 ============

 Charles Dye (original author):
 ------------------------------

 v0.90    1998-03-13    4,086 bytes                         2C8EBD68  2C4E
   Initial beta release.

 v0.91    1998-03-15    3,900 bytes                         AFB852A6  B4A7
   Changed two-pass parser to one-pass, removing 31-filespec limit.  Moved
   fnbuf to uninitialized data area.

 v0.92    1998-03-26    3,968 bytes
   Allow Q for 'quit' in addition to Y and N responses.  Q will abort with
   errorlevel 3 like Control-C or Control-Break, but will print any /V
   summary first.  Adds version and copyright strings for Mark Aitchison's
   VERSION.EXE program.  Includes newer address for the Free Software
   Foundation.

 v0.93    1998-03-30    3,970 bytes
   Fixed sloppy calculations involving stack bottom and top addresses, and
   program size.  Should not make a bit of difference in program operation.

 v1.00    1998-08-05    4,042 bytes
   Workaround for a serious issue with earlier releases of the DOS-C kernel.
   21/4301 could convert subdirectories into files....  The filespec cleanup
   routine now removes any duplicated backslashes from the filespec.  Syntax
   message now mentions /D (guess I won't delete the debug code after all.)

 v1.00a   1998-08-13    4,050 bytes                         0961803F  93C4
   Fixes an incompatibility with 8086 and 8088 CPUs (logical shifts with
   immediate count values.)

 v1.01    1999-01-17    4,318 bytes                         B62CB7DF  3DBA
   Added a safety check:  If items in the root directory are to be deleted
   and /Y is specified, the user will be prompted anyhow.  Also, new debug
   switch /X prevents the program from actually deleting anything.

 v1.02    1999-05-19    4,220 bytes                         EB86016F  FE99
   Fix for a problem with redirection of stdin under FreeDOS.  The Y-or-N
   keystroke is now read using the keyboard BIOS instead of via DOS.  New
   error handler with inline arguments makes the program slightly smaller.

 v1.02a   1999-05-23    4,250 bytes                         3E1DFD07  3EFE
   Disabled the root-safety check on removable drives.

 v1.02b   1999-07-27    4,220 bytes                         6228F0D7  5149
   Rewritten for NASM.  Fixed a trivial bug (incorrect return code when no
   filespec specified.)  Minor bumming.  Added %defines to control assembly
   of /Y, /V, and /D code.

 v1.02c   2000-04-24    4,210 bytes                         8B60E5F5  CF56
   Expanded the filespec buffers to 260 bytes to handle the super-long
   pathnames permitted under Windows 95/98.

 v1.02e   2003-06-22    4,478 bytes                         2186E74C  E851
   Compile-time option to permit switches to appear anywhere on the command
   line.  (The default behavior is still to permit switches only before the
   first filespec, mimicking Microsoft's.)  Tweaks to the syntax text to
   make it more informative.  /X is now documented.  All dates are now in
   ISO format.


 Eric Auer:
 ----------

 v1.02f   2005-04-06
   Removed a now inappropriate bug-bug compatibility mode for old FreeDOS
   kernels: OEM version 0fdh, CX 0 or -1, but CX 0 has to be used by NEW
   kernels as well, to work-around a 32RTM bug. Most DOS kernels use CX 0.
   For reference: This un-does the "DOS-C" workaround introduced in 1.00!
   Shortened some "switches before filespecs" / GPL / error messages.
   Found COMPILE TIME OPTIONS in 1.02e to be: Y, V, D, munga check all on,
   arbitrary argument order off. In 1.02e deltree2: Same: V, D on, but
   Y and munga check off. Arbitrary argument order off.


 MR-LEGO (maintainer):
 ---------------------

 v1.02g   2013-03-30
   - Renamed the source file from "DELTREE.S" to "DELTREE.ASM"
   - Fixed the error in the the "ROOT-SAFETY-CHECK"-warning-message: After printing the
     string a never ending and strange chain of characters was displayed.
     The PC seems to be frozen. Fixed by adding a "$" at the end of the
     "ROOT-SAFETY-CHECK"-message-string. Many thanks to Mr Eric Auer for his help!
   - Added the call to the 'y/n/q'-prompt-message after the "ROOT-SAFETY-CHECK"-message.
     Because it was missing.
   - Fixed the call of the "ROOT-SAFETY-CHECK". Because this prompt was displayed
     even the specified file or directory was not found.
   - Added the error-message "File or Directory was not found!". If a specified file
     or directory was not found, this message will be displayed now instead
     of nothing. The errorlevel is set to 1 instead of 0 now.
   - Fixed the filelist-BUG: At the end of the filelist (EOF) at least a "CARRIAGE RETURN",
     "LINE FEED" or a "SPACE" was needed otherwise the last filename-entry wasn't
     handled correctly.
   - If a filelist was not found the errorlevel is set to 1 instead of 0 now.
   - Added a check and an error-message if the specified commandline is longer than
     126 characters. This check could be excluded. Then an alternate fix for the end of
     the commandline buffer is included. This is necessary because commandline-processors
     which allows more than 126 characters do exist!
   - Removed "length-check" of reading filespec from commandline, because it gets maximal
     126 characters from commandline and so the filespec-buffer can't be overflowed.
   - Added the message: "DELTREE is in TEST-mode" if the "/X"-switch is given
   - Only in the [DEFAULT-BUILD]: Added the message "DEFAULT-BUILD of DELTREE"
   - Only in the [DEFANGED-BUILD]: Added the message "DEFANGED-BUILD of DELTREE"
   - Only in the [DANGER-BUILD]: Added the message "DANGER-BUILD of DELTREE"     
   - Include %ifdef ... %endif for the X-switch to exclude it if you need.
   - Moved the complete "version log" from the source file into the file "HISTORY.TXT"
   - Added constants for the "version-number", "date of build", "name of the maintainer"
     and the "e-mail-address" at the begin of the source code. Now it's used instead of
     hard coded strings in the syntax help.
   - For a better overview, deleted lines in the source file, that are surplus now.
   - Improvements to reduce code, take messages nicer, better overview in the source code
   - Added the file "CONTENT.TXT" that describes the content of this package
   - Added paths into the package-file
   - Built and added the binary DELTREE!.COM ("DANGER-BUILD") to the package.
     Without the "ROOT-SAFETY-CHECK"! So it's like the Microsoft-DELTREE.
     
     WARNING!!!
     It's the most dangerous version of DELTREE!!! NO WARRANTY! USE IT ON YOUR OWN RISK!
     DON'T BLAME ME FOR ANY DATALOSS AND DAMAGES!!!
     IF YOU AREN'T SURE WHAT YOU DO, DON'T USE IT!!!
