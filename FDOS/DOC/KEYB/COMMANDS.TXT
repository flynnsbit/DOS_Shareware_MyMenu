TypeID Module#  Description
-----------------------------------
   d     1      Diacritic sequence starter
   be    2      Beep
   b     3      Basic command
   e     4      Extended command
   l     5      Standard Shift/locks
   u     6      User defined keys

NUMBER    TYPE  STATUS DESCRIPTION
===============================================================================
      0   b     2.0    IGNORE. 
                       The driver behaves as if this scancode/plane hadn't been
                       found in the table.
                       Possible scancode translation is not taken into account.

  1- 79   s     2.0    Displays one of the strings from the string pool of the
                       current submapping of the KeybCB.
                       The command number indicates the string to be displayed.
                       Therefore, a maximum of 79 strings is admissible.
                       If the string does not exist, the string is sought in
                       in the general submapping.
                       If the string does neither exist there, the command is
                       ignored.

 80- 89   l    -       STANDARD SHIFTS AND LOCKS OFF
                       Clear the appropiate flag on BIOS variables.
                       These commands perform the standard BIOS variable
                       maintainnance due, and can be used to duplicate the key's
                       behaviour.
                          80:  Right CONTROL
                          81:  Right  ALT (AltGr)
                          82:  Right  SHIFT
                          83:  Left   Shift
                          84:  Left   Control
                          85:  Left   Alt
                          86:  Scroll Lock
                          87:  Num    Lock
                          88:  Caps   Lock
                          89:  INSERT

 90- 99   l    -       STANDARD SHIFTS AND LOCKS ON
                       Set the appropiate flag on BIOS variables.
                       These commands perform the standard BIOS variable
                       maintainnance due, and can be used to duplicate the key's
                       behaviour.
                          90:  Right CONTROL
                          91:  Right  ALT (AltGr)
                          92:  Right  SHIFT
                          93:  Left   Shift
                          94:  Left   Control
                          95:  Left   Alt
                          96:  Scroll Lock
                          97:  Num    Lock
                          98:  Caps   Lock
                          99:  INSERT

    100   b    2.0     DISABLE.
                       Disables KEYB.

    101   b    2.0     ENABLE first layout.
102-119   e    -       ENABLE alternative layouts (command N enables layout
                       N-100)

120-139   e    2.0     CHANGE CURRENT SUBMAPPING.
                       Command N changes the active submapping to the (N-119)
                       submapping.
                       Codepage is not checked. On a misdesigned KeybCB, it may
                       cause a codepage change, leaving KEYB therefore in an
                       inconsistent space.

140-143   e    2.0     INTERRUPT TRIGGERING.
                       These actions are performed by some standard key
                       pressings, and may therefore be remapped.
                          140: Print Screen (INT  5h)
                          141: Reset        (INT 19h)
                          142: Break        (INT 1Bh)
                          143: SysReq       (INT 15h/ah=85h)

                       NOTES ABOUT 143:
                       - On activation of the command (usually after releasing a
                         key) it will BOTH call the SysReq press / SysReq
                         release functions one right after the other (provided
                         that the function is supported, return AH=0)

150-154   p     2.0     POWER COMMANDS: commands 150-152 are standard legacy
                       power management commands, whereas 153-154 require
                       APMBIOS 1.1+
                          150: Flush disk caches
                          151: Warm reboot
                          152: Cold reboot
                          153: Power off
                          154: Suspend
160       b     2.0    NO OPERATION. Does nothing (neither passing control to
                       next KEYB).

161       b     2.0    DECIMAL CHAR.
                       On P4, prints the decimal char if defined by /Dx. If
                        none was used, "." is used as default.
                       On kb2  and later, prints the decimal char defined by
                        the KeybCB or "." if none was defined. This can be
                        overriden by using the /Dx parameter.

162       be    2.0    BEEP.
                       Produces a sound alert.

163       e     2.0    PAUSE.
                       Enters the PAUSE loop.

164       e     2.0    TOGGLES.
                       Turns on/off KEYB flags.
                          164: Beeping on/off

                       NOTE:
                       Beeps will be produced on these circumstances:
                       - Full keyboard buffer
                       - Wrong diacritic combination
                       - command 162
                       Toggle 164 will disable all of them

168-179   e     2.0     ALTERNATIVE CHARACTER INTRODUCTION.
                       These commands duplicate the behaviour of the
                       traditional Alt+Numpad character introduction.
                          168:      Clear memory
                          169:      Release character
                          170-179:  New digit (0..9)

                       NOTE: command 169 is automatically triggered upon
                       releasing an ALT key, unless overriden.

180-187   u     2.0    USER DEFINED KEYS OFF.
                       It deactivates one of the eight user flags to be used to
                       produce extra planes. Command N deactivates the
                       (N-179)th user key.

188-195   u     2.0    USER DEFINED KEYS ON.
                       It activates one of the eight user flags to be used to
                       produce extra planes. Command N activates the (N-187)th
                       user key.

200-234   d     2.0    DIACRITIC SEQUENCE STARTERS.
                       These start up the 35 maximally admissible diacritic
                       sequences.
                       Command N will start the (N-199)th COMBI sequence
                       found in current submapping.
                       If the diacritic sequence does not exist, it is sought
                       in the general submapping.
                       If the sequence does neither exist there, the command
                       is ignored.
