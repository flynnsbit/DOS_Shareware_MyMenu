0.10 - 20 apr 02

    tom: basic design and implementation

0.14 - 24 apr 02

    tom: after some discussion with and help from aitor,
    first semi public release (to Aitor, Bart + Arkady)
    with 4 supported languages (GR,SP,NL,RU)

    design seems to be working ok,
    codetables have to be done/verified
    waiting for feedback

0.15 - 24 apr 02
    tom: fixed decimaldingsbums 

0.17 - 26 apr 02
    tom:  fixed CAPSLOCK handling
          added scan code display in debug mode
    bart: added UK table
    
0.18 - 27 apr 02
    tom: capslock handling for COMBI's corrected 
         added 10 other languages

0.25 - 29 mai 02
    tom: changed table definitions, so that polish 
    requirements (ALTGREY+SHIFT) are implementable
    saved a few bytes by that
    
    arkady: changed all keyboard definitions to
    use macros - less prone to errors

0.26 - released 17 jun 02
    some fine tuning by tom and arkady.   
    
    
0.32 - 9 august 02
    added brazil keyboard driver (BR+BX)
    merged all executables into a single one.
    slight increase of this single executable (4K->7K)
    but saves installing 20 .EXE files    
    
0.34 - 18 september 02
    added french keyboard

0.35 - 21 october 02
    corrections to french keyboard (provided by snoopy81)

0.36 - 10 feb     03
    added experimental belgique 

0.37 - 3 march 03
    belgian keyboard is OK for imre (after some corrections)
    added uninstall /U support
    added changing the layout on the fly by uninstalling old KEYB first
    renamed MKEYB.EXE to KEYB.EXE, as users probably expect KEYB

0.38 - 23 may 03    
    version 0.38 was done entirely by Anton Zinoviev; 
    I really appreciate it to be maintainer in that way :-))
    here is what he writes:
>>>    
    I added keydefbg.h and keydefbp.h -- these are the two Bulgarian
    keyboard layouts.
    
    For non-latin languages there must be some easy way to switch between
    QWERTY and the language layout.  Alt+Ctrl+F1/F2 are too uncomfortable.
    So I added the possibility to use the Right Ctrl as a switch for these
    languages (currently Bulgarian, Hebrew and Russian).  The right Ctrl
    acts as a switch only when it is pressed and immediately released.  It
    preserves its ability to generate Control codes.
    
    It was a real pleasure to read the code of mkeyb. :-)

0.39 - 24 sep 03
	finally implemented KEYB US - by deinstalling old keyboard handler
	added experimantal Slovenian keyboard
	
0.40 - 17 mar 04
	Changed the used EXE Packer; now APACK (http://www.ibsensoftware.com)
	is the exepacker of choice (although UPX still works exellent, too)
	This reduces KEYB.EXE by 200 Byte.
	This also changes the licensing, as GPL doesn't allow using exepackers 
	of my own choice :((
	See license.txt for details
