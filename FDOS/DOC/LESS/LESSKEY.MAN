NAME
     lesskey - specify key bindings for less

SYNOPSIS
     lesskey [-o output] [input]
     lesskey -V

DESCRIPTION
     _L_e_s_s_k_e_y is used to specify a set of key bindings to be  used
     by  _l_e_s_s.  The input file is a text file which describes the
     key bindings, If the input file is "-",  standard  input  is
     read.   If  no  input  file  is specified, $HOME/.lesskey is
     read.  The output file is a binary file  which  is  used  by
     _l_e_s_s.  If  no output file is specified, $HOME/.less is writ-
     ten.  If  the  output  file  already  exists,  _l_e_s_s_k_e_y  will
     overwrite it.

     The -V flag causes _l_e_s_s_k_e_y to print its version  number  and
     immediately  exit.  If  -V is present, other flags and argu-
     ments are ignored.

     The input file consists of one or more _s_e_c_t_i_o_n_s.  Each  sec-
     tion starts with a line that identifies the type of section.
     Possible sections are:

     #command
          Defines new command keys.

     #line-edit
          Defines new line-editing keys.

     #env Defines environment variables.

     Blank lines and lines which start with a pound sign (#)  are
     ignored, except for the special section header lines.


COMMAND SECTION
     The command section begins with the line

     #command

     If the command section is the first  section  in  the  file,
     this  line  may be omitted.  The command section consists of
     lines of the form:

          _s_t_r_i_n_g <whitespace> _a_c_t_i_o_n [extra-string] <newline>

     Whitespace is any sequence of  one  or  more  spaces  and/or
     tabs.   The  _s_t_r_i_n_g  is  the command key(s) which invoke the
     action.  The _s_t_r_i_n_g may  be  a  single  command  key,  or  a
     sequence  of  up  to 15 keys.  The _a_c_t_i_o_n is the name of the



                                                                1






LESSKEY(1)               USER COMMANDS                 LESSKEY(1)



     less action, from the list below.   The  characters  in  the
     _s_t_r_i_n_g  may  appear  literally, or be prefixed by a caret to
     indicate a control key.  A  backslash  followed  by  one  to
     three octal digits may be used to specify a character by its
     octal value.  A backslash followed by b, e, n, r or t speci-
     fies  BACKSPACE,  ESCAPE,  NEWLINE,  RETURN  or TAB, respec-
     tively.  A backslash followed by any other  character  indi-
     cates  that  character is to be taken literally.  Characters
     which must be preceded by backslash  include  caret,  space,
     tab and the backslash itself.

     An action may be followed by an "extra" string.  When such a
     command  is  entered  while running _l_e_s_s, the action is per-
     formed, and then the extra string is parsed, just as  if  it
     were  typed  in to _l_e_s_s. This feature can be used in certain
     cases to extend the functionality of a command.   For  exam-
     ple, see the "{" and ":t" commands in the example below.

PRECEDENCE
     Commands specified  by  _l_e_s_s_k_e_y  take  precedence  over  the
     default  commands.  A default command key may be disabled by
     including it in the input file with  the  action  "invalid".
     Alternatively,  a  key may be defined to do nothing by using
     the action "noaction".  "noaction" is similar to  "invalid",
     but  _l_e_s_s  will give an error beep for an "invalid" command,
     but not for a "noaction" command.  In addition, ALL  default
     commands  may be disabled by adding this control line to the
     input file:

     #stop

     This will cause all default commands  to  be  ignored.   The
     #stop  line  should  be the last line in that section of the
     file.

     Be aware that #stop can be dangerous. Since all default com-
     mands  are  disabled,  you  must provide sufficient commands
     before the #stop line to enable all necessary actions.   For
     example,  failure  to  provide  a "quit" command can lead to
     frustration.


LINE EDITING SECTION
     The line-editing section begins with the line:

     #line-edit

     This section specifies new key bindings for the line editing
     commands,  in  a  manner similar to the way key bindings for
     ordinary commands are specified  in  the  #command  section.
     The  line-editing  section  consists  of  a list of keys and
     actions, one per line as in the example below.


EXAMPLE
     The following input file describes the set of default  line-
     editing keys used by less:

          #line-edit
          \t        forw-complete
          \17       back-complete
          \e\t      back-complete
          \14       expand
          ^V        literal



                                                                4






LESSKEY(1)               USER COMMANDS                 LESSKEY(1)



          ^A        literal
          \el       right
          \eh       left
          \eb       word-left
          \ew       word-right
          \ei       insert
          \ex       delete
          \e\b      word-backspace
          \e0       home
          \e$       end
          \ek       up
          \ej       down



LESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     The environment variable section begins with the line

     #env

     Following this  line  is  a  list  of  environment  variable
     assignments.   Each line consists of an environment variable
     name, an equals sign (=) and the value to be assigned to the
     environment  variable.   White  space  before  and after the
     equals sign is ignored.  Variables assigned in this way  are
     visible only to _l_e_s_s. If a variable is specified in the sys-
     tem environment and also in a lesskey file, the value in the
     lesskey  file  takes  precedence.  Although the lesskey file
     can be used to override variables set  in  the  environment,
     the  main purpose of assigning variables in the lesskey file
     is simply to have all _l_e_s_s configuration information  stored
     in one file.


EXAMPLE
     The following input file sets the -i flag whenever  _l_e_s_s  is
     run, and specifies the character set to be "latin1":

          #env
          LESS = -i
          LESSCHARSET = latin1

WARNINGS
     It is not possible to specify special keys, such as uparrow,
     in  a  keyboard-independent manner.  The only way to specify
     such  keys  is  to  specify  the  escape  sequence  which  a
