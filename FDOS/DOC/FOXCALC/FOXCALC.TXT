FoxCalc v0.92 Copyright (C) Mateusz Viste "Fox" 2007


FoxCalc is  a simple  calculator for  DOS with  a text  user interface. The
program has a mouse suports,  so take care  to run your mouse driver before
launching FoxCalc, it will be much easier to use it.

If you really can't use a mouse,  you will find below the  list of shortcut
keys.  That list should automatically appear anyway if FoxCalc can't find a
mouse driver.

CALCULATION
FoxCalc is  making use of the GMP  (GNU Multi Precision Library)  and  MPFR
libraries for all calculations. That makes it an accurate and very reliable
tool.  All operations are  performed with a 60 digits resolution.  Floating
point  numbers  which  don't fit  into  the window  are  truncated  without
any rounding.
When using the MOD function in FoxCalc,  you can get different results than
in other computer calculators or  programming languages.  That's not a bug.
The modulo operation on negative numbers can be done using several methods.
Usually,  computers are  processing an "X MOD Y"  operation using  absolute
values of X and Y, and changes the result's signum to the X's sign.  That's
the easiest way, and that's how Intel processors work.  FoxCalc is behaving
differently. Therefore, the "7 mod -3" operation may be computed as  "1" on
other calculators, when FoxCalc will report "-2". Both results are correct.

CODEPAGE & LOCALES
As there are some buttons which are described with ASCII characters greater
than ASCII #127,  FoxCalc is detecting the system's codepage and change the
buttons  descriptions if  the codepage  can't display  them  correctly. For
example, the square button is "๛" on CP437, and becomes "SQR" on CP850.
The separators (decimal separator and thousands separator) are  copied from
the system's settings.  If you would like to change them,  just change your
system's settings (usually using COUNTRY.SYS).

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
FoxCalc doesn't have any  special requirements.  It runs in protected mode,
therefore it will need at least an 80386 CPU.  A color EGA video card would
be nice too,  as well as 1 MByte of memory.  I recommend to launch it under
FreeDOS, but I guess any system compatible with MSDOS 5.0 will be okay.

LEGAL MUMBO-JUMBO
I will keep it short.  It's an open-source project,  so feel free to modify
the source-code at your convenience,  and let me know of  any improvements.
Go look into the GNU/GPL v2 (or higher) license for any details.

CREDITS
I would like to say a  big "thank you" to  people which  helped me with the
FoxCalc developpment, that is:
 * DrV (freebasic.net forum): Codepage detecting routine,  and many general
    hints on using the FreeBASIC compiler.
 * srvaldez (freebasic.net forum): Much help on  adaptating the  GMP & MPFR
    libraries to be used with FoxCalc,  and gave me a hint for checking the
    overflow of exponentiation operations.
 * MichaelW  (freebasic.net  forum): Thousands   and   decimal   separators
    retrieving routine.
