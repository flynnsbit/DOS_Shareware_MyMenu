None.

Known Issues
------------
Cats message support not supported with all compilers,
  specifically it will not compile with Dave Dunfield's Micro-C/PC,
  and with HiTech's Pacific C 7.5
It does not indicate if initial directory (on valid drive) does not exist.
When compiled with Pacific C may incorrectly report invalid drive,
this is a bug in findfirst.h and not in tree (released version compiled 
with Borland C/C++ 3.1 so does not have this problem).
