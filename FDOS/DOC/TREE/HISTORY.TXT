     Aitor Santamaria Merino reviewed and updated Spanish
     message catalog (tree.es).  No source changes.

January 2001    Tree 3.6 - Jeremy Davis <jeremyd@computer.org>
     Modified tree to properly compile for DOS with Micro-C/PC (tested 
     with versions 3.14, 3.15, and 3.21), Borland's Turbo C 2.01,
     Turbo C/C++ 1.01 and 3.0 (and BCC3.1); and to compile
     for Win32 using Borland's BCC5.5.1, and Microsoft Visual C/C++ 5.
     Directly supports volume label.  Includes optional support for
     cats message library.  DOS versions are short names only (8.3)
     and Win32 versions are long names only.  Released Feb 7, 2001
