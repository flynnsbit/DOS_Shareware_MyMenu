         LEGEND
    * = Added feature  
    ! = Bug Fixed      
    ~ = Changed                              
------------------------

NOTE: No changes of the help viewer in version 1.0.6 and version 1.0.7
of the help as I am no programmer!


Version 5.3.3
  * Will still load English version if %LANG% is set to a language
    that htmlhelp cannot find in the help directory.
  * Support for Wheelmouse API when using Cutemouse 2 Alpha (untested).

Version 5.3.2
Robert Platt:
  * Unicode (UTF-8) decoding
  * All HTML 4.0 character entities now defined
  * Numeric Character References (e.g. &#1234;) allowed
  * Support of the above three items for the following codepages:
    437, 737, 808, 850, 851, 852, 853, 855, 857,
    858, 860, 861, 863, 865, 866, 869, 872.
  * Autodetect of the codepage
  * NLS catalogue support - allows translation of user interface strings
  * Two fancy color schemes added, through options /f1 and /f2
  * Can open zip files directly from command line
  * Back/Forward browsing now remembers bookmarks within pages
  * Improved file loading. Zips no longer need to be in a
    subdirectory of the help directory. Help will look for index.htm
    in same directory as exe, and in current directory, if no found
    in help directory.
  * Alt+F4 can exit help
  ! Fixed ability to load files from outside of the help directory
  ! Fixed bug in topic search mechanism, where for example format would
    be loaded when user asked for "for"
  ! Fixed little bugs in how errors are reported when file cannot be opened
  ! html files greater than 32k in zip files no longer report an error
  ! Formatting mistake on search box help screen fixed.
  ! keyboard browses correctly after going to a NAME anchor (bookmark).

Version 5.3.1
Robert Platt:
  * Search Box: search the help content or a single page.
  * Can press letters to navigate links
  ! Plain text files (files without .htm extension) can now contain < and >
  ! bold, italics and links that span two or more lines will now display
    properly even if the they start off the top of the screen
  ! console cursor position is restored on exiting
  ! The /O and /L command line work again (broken in v5.3.0)
  ! Links which contain ".." directories now work even with zips
  ~ Maximum allowed length of link text in html increased
  ~ html parsing speed improved
  ~ code structure improvements and general optimisation

Version 5.3.0
Robert Platt:
  * Support for compressed help in zip files

Version 5.2.1
Robert Platt:
  ~ Exact matches of topics in index.htm now take precedence over
    files (so that the typical usage is faster).
  * user abort possible during long search for nearest match to a topic
  * /A switch added, which tells help to use standard ASCII characters
    instead of extended character block graphics.
  * HELPCMD environment variable can be used to preset /A and /M switches.
  ! fixed bug in user interface - ghost links occasionally loaded
    e.g. when using scroll bar (The check for whether the mouse was
    within the main window (where the links are) had the wrong boundary
    conditions.) 
  ! Detect, rather than assume, enhanced (101/102 key) keyboard
  ~ GNU Indent run to beautify the source code (this to be done on
    all future releases).

Version 5.2
Robert Platt:
  ~ New help system will use ..\help\index.htm as default help path.
  * Checks %helppath% environment variable to locate index.htm
    (previously only fasthelp used this)
  * Support for multiple help file sets:
    Checks to see whether a topic specified on the command line
    matches any files on the help path before doing the usual search
    in index.htm. A subtopic can be passed to such a file.
  * Enhanced keyboard browsing. Arrow keys now move between links.
    Alt+Left and Alt+Right moves back and forth between history (Netscape
    and IE use these).
    (Also, Alt+Up and Alt+Down behave how Up and Down used to.)
  * Semi-infinite browsing
  * Allows html files to have parameters in the body tag
  * Full support for comments <!-- -->
  * F5/Ctrl+R can be used to refresh the current document (useful for
    writing documents in a windowing environment)
  ! Fixed memory bug in the GUI
  ! Fixed memory bug in the header tag code
  ! Fixed slight bug in scroll bar positioning
  ! Fixed bug conflicts when browsing links with both mouse and keyboard
    together
  ! Word-wrapping is now aware of character entities (&copy; etc).
  ~ Code clean-up
  ~ Bright Yellow used for links (still much more readable on laptops
    than the older colour system, but much better than green is for
    CRT monitor users.) (Joe Cosentino's idea - thanks Joe)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
      From Version 5.1.2B onwards, the new help file set was
      introduced - hhstndrd - under the GNU FDL license. This has
      its own seperate history and version number.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.1.0B
Robert Platt:
  ~ old /files documentation removed from this release.
  ~ The home page has been changed from help.htm to htmldocs\index.htm.
  * Neater rendering of HTML through detection of excessive newlines
  ! Fixed a bug in the word wrapping
  ! Fixed a bug where <A NAME="something"> tags are treated as <A HREF="..."
    tags.
  ~ various tags tweaked
  * Support for two new character entities: &para; and &sect;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
      From Version 5.1.0B onwards, support of the old /files HTML
      documentation ceased.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.0.1   13/11/2002
Robert Platt:
  * in 43- and 50- line color text modes, help now takes advantage of the
    additional screen space.
  ! the command-prompt screen is now restored on exiting help (unless the
    video mode is changed)
  ! the cursor is restored after exiting
  ! the video-mode is only set when necessary
  ! fixed some flaws in the interpretation of relative links
  ~ improved interpretation of the <h1> and <pre> tags: h1 is now bold and
    these two tags begin new paragraphs
  ~ 'Next' has been renamed to 'Forward' in the navigation
  ~ Alt+B, as well as backspace, can be used to navigate 'Back'

Version 5.0.0B  01/11/2002
Robert Platt became maintainer.
Paul Hsieh and Robert Platt:
  * Less need for HTML files to be preformatted (built in word wrapping)
  * Supports HTML '&___;' escape codes such as &nbsp; and &copy;
  * header tags <h1> through <h3> are supported. <h1> puts a border around
    text for titles, removing the need for non-standard characters in the
    HTML files which were used to create this effect.
  * Improved navigation with 'Exit', 'Contents', 'Next' and 'Help on Help'
  * Support for Shift-Tab, to complement Tab for going between links.
  * Mouse can now page up and down by clicking on scroll bar area.
  * /o command-line option can be used to open many other text and HTML
    files.
  ! Fixed a problem where the machine hanged after browsing links deeply.
  ! Fixed various minor bugs
  ! Accessibility improved: new color schemes are readable on LCD screens,
    and on monochrome (especially with the /m command-line option)
  ! Status-bar does not just show links that the mouse hovers over, it also
    show links highlighted by the keyboard.
