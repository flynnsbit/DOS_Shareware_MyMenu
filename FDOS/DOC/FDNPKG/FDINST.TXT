                    Copyright (C) 2015-2016 Mateusz Viste

FDINST is a very 'light' version of FDNPKG. It shares most of its source code
with FDNPKG to ensure that both tools handle packages exactly the same way.

FDINST however is a much simpler tool:
 - no internationalization support
 - no networking
 - no repository handling
 - no support for the LZMA compression method

Shortly said, FDINST is able to do only two basic things:
 - installing a single package from a local FreeDOS ZIP package
 - removing an already installed package

The advantage of FDINST is that it is a 16-bit tool with very low hardware
requirements:
 - 8086 CPU or compatible
 - 200K of available conventional RAM

Usage and syntax: type "FDINST --help" for usage help.
