2. What XKeyb is
================

As the name suggests, XKeyb is a keyboard driver with a certain resemblance
to the well-known KEYB.COM.

As with KEYB, XKeyb is also a keyboard driver for DOS-based computers, which is
installed as a memory-resident program and can be configured for different
countries using parameters. 

However XKeyb allows many more configuration options than Keyb. Thus, you can
configure XKeyb not only for different countries, but also for your own
personal preferences.

On the one hand XKeyb permits the free allocation of all keys on all levels
(normally with SHIFT, CTRL, ALT, and CTRL-ALT), while on the other hand it
offers the flexibility to define character strings to individual keys on
certain levels.

Furthermore for each key it can be determined separately whether it is
influenced by CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK or SCROLL LOCK, and if the SHIFT, CTRL, and
ALT keys determine what values are issued.

The programmer is provided with a PI (Program Interface) to XKeyb. It allows
access to many of the XKeyb functions.

Appart from XKEYB, you may also use MKEYB, that you will also find within
the FreeDOS main site, in the same place where you downloaded xkeyb. MKeyb
is a minimalistic KEYB implementation for FreeDOS.

There are some differences between mkeyb and xkeyb, namely:
- The extended user-defined Xfunctions and XStrings support is not present
in mkeyb
- xkeyb is configurable through .KEY files, whereas mkeyb has the information
hardcoded, and needs recompilation to change it. This way, there are separate
MKEYBSP, MKEYBGR, MKEYBNL, etc.
- both support COMBIs, and COMBI can be enabled/disabled, in xkeyb through
configuration, and in mkeyb upon recompilation
- mkeyb is much smaller in size, and therefore, it is ideal for those systems
in which resident size and executable size are critical


3. How XKeyb is used 
====================

The general use of XKeyb is identical to that of KEYB.COM. The program is
installed by using the command:

XKEYB <Configuration File> 

Standard configuration files are contained within MS-DOS for all countries,
which are also used by KEYB.COM. The names of these files consists of the
well-known "Country Code" and the extension KEY. Thus to install XKeyb for a
German keyboard you would use the command:

XKEYB GR or XKEYB GR.KEY. 

In addition to the standard definitions XKeyb includes the file GR2.KEY. This
file contains a definition for a German keyboard with geringfugigen and
anderungen. Additionally the function of the CAPS LOCK key of SHIFT LOCK
is geandert in a genuine Caps LOCK, which applies exclusively to the
character keys.

These standard key assignment definitions are used to serve as a basis for
non-standard adjustments. All manipulations of the key assignment made with
XKeyb become additional definition files, which use the extension KEY. The
use of other extensions must be explicitly indicated in the call to XKeyb.

These definition files are text files using a similar structure to that of
Windows INI files. The exact structure is described in the next section. 

If the key allocation needs to be modified after XKeyb has been installed,
then this is easily done by using a renewed call to XKeyb with another
definition file specified (the resident copy of XKeyb is re-used).

One further note on Extension Strings ("XStrings"):

Under normal conditions XKeyb reserves only the minimum required amount of
workspace for XStrings that is required for essential operations (rounded up
to a full paragraph). If additional XStrings are to be created, then the /Xnn
switch should be used to explicitly set the amount of storage space to be
reserved for XStrings (where nn is the memory-size indicated in bytes).

e.g. To install XKeyb with 480 bytes workstation for XStrings and with German
     key assignment, use this command:

XKEYB GR /X480 
      or 
XKEYB /X480 GR 

Four more switches are available when XKeyb is installed:

/U   (Uninstall), removes the resident copy from XKeyb from memory (if 
      installed)
/Q   (Quiet), suppresses the output of LIST paragraph in configuration
      files (see the next section).
/?   Fast help: shows how to use XKEYB



4. The structure of a configuration file 
========================================

A configuration file for XKeyb is divided into several paragraphs, each of
which contain a section of the entire keyboard definition. Thus the paragraph
KEYS defines the actual key allocation, (i.e. which characters and if necessary
which XStrings are situated on which key). Extension Strings are defined in
the XSTRINGS paragraph. The SHIFT paragraph defines which keys functions are
assigned to using SHIFT, CTRL and ALT. The COMBI paragraph is used to define
combination characters (e.g. ^ + a = â). COMMENT and LIST paragraphs may be
placed within other paragraphs wherever needed, and the paragraphs can appear
in any sequence.

Any line starting with ; is considered a comment, and thus ignored, regardless of
the section where it may appear.

The file GR2.KEY is a practical example for the structure of a definition file.

The following is a detailed description of the individual paragraphs: 


[ KEYS ]

This paragraph contains one key definition per line. The line begins with
the Scancode of the key, immediately followed by one or more of N, C or S
This is use to indicate if the key should be influenced by NUM-, CAPS-, or
SCROLL-LOCK.

The scancode can be optionally preceded by the E or e character, meaning that
it corresponds to an extended scancode key, preceded by the E0 scancode. Check
the appropriate section of this manual to know more about these keys.

The rest of the line is made up of a list of 5 key levels, which define the
character to be output when the key is pressed by itself, or with SHIFT,
CTRL, ALT and ALT Gr (in that order). These values should be separated by
spaces. The values can be either the actual characters, or their ASCII codes
preceded by a "#" character. An example line from GR2.KEY follows:

 72N #0 8 #26 #0 E

Characters with ASCII values less than 36 are always indicated using the "#"
character.

Instead of a character, a decimal number followed by an exclamation mark can
be used to assign an extension string or function to the key. The numbers 1-200
are available for XStrings, while the values greater than 200 are reserved for
special functions, as listed in the table below:

Value          Meaning
-------  --------------------------------------------------------------------
201-235  Reserved for user defined XFunctions
         (see the PI section for more information)
236-245  Reserved for COMBI-subsystem
246      Reserved
247      OS/2 2.0: DOS box close. (ALT-F4)
248      Reserved
249      Break interrupt
250      Disables XKEYB
251      Suspends the PC (requires APM-BIOS 1.1 or later). Caches are flushed
252      Turns the PC off (requires APM-BIOS 1.1 or later). Caches are flushed
253      System cold reset. Caches are flushed
254      Print Screen (hardcopy)
255      System warm reset. Caches are flushed before it


Finally, one can specify that certain level on certain Scancode initialises a
COMBI section (as for example, ` or ^). This is specified by an exclamation
mark followed by C and the number of the row that describes the COMBI
behaviour.

For example,
40 !C2 #0 #0 #0 #0
indicates that pressing key whose scancode is 40 will start the COMBI sequence
described on the second row of the COMBI section.

[ SHIFTS ]

This paragraph is used to define the shift and lock keys. This is just a list
of the key scancodes, spearated by spaces, in the following order:

SHIFT1 SHIFT2 CTRL ALT SCROLL NUM CAPS INSERT 


[ XSTRINGS ]

This paragraph is used to define extension strings. The format is:

<Number> <String> 

Note that a space must be placed between the Number and the String. All
characters (including spaces) after the first space are interpreted as
part of the Extension String.

The Extension String is assigned to a key in the [ KEYS ] paragraph.

Valid numbers for XStrings are in the range 1-200. An example follows:

[XSTRINGS]
1 Dat is 'ne Schdring
2 DIR *.ABC | SORT | MORE\n
17 Mit freundlichen Grussen
123 \[DEL]\[CD]\[AF10]

As you can see inthe above example, various special characters can be used in
XStrings, preceded by a "\" character. The available special characters are as
follows:

Special              Value Produced
-------  --------------------------------------
\\       \
\Axxx    Character with the ASCII value xxx
\Sxxx    Key with the Scancode xxx
\n       Carriage Return (equivalent to \A013)
\[HOME]  HOME key
\[END]   END key
\[PU]    PAGE UP key
\[PD]    PAGE DOWN key
\[CL]    CURSOR LEFT key
\[CR]    CURSOR RIGHT key
\[CU]    CURSOR UP key
\[CD]    CURSOR DOWN key
\[DEL]   DEL key
\[INS]   INS key
\[Fx]    Function key #x 
\[SFx]   SHIFT + Function key #x
\[CFx]   CTRL + Function key #x
\[AFx]   ALT + Function key #x

The HOME, END, PU, PD, CL and CR keys can be prededed with the leter "C"
This corresponds to a press of the respective key while holding the CTRL key.


[ COMBI ]

This paragraph is used to define combination characters.
The first character of each line is the "combination character", and is followed
by several pairs of characters. When XKeyb detects the "combination character"
along with the first character of a character pair, it will output the second
character of the pair.

Example: 

' a  e‚ i¡ o¢ u£ #32'

the line above defines the following combination keys:

'+a= 
'+e=‚
'+i=¡
'+o=¢
'+u=£
'+<SPACE>='

Non-printable characters are indicated by their ASCII value as the first
character of a character pair.

The exclamation mark has a special function: It clears the existing definition
for a group of combination characters:

^! aâ 

This line clears all existing combination characters beginning with ^ and then
defines the combination ^+a=â.


[ CONTINUE ]

This paragraph contains only one line. It contains the name of another
configuration file. If XKeyb finds this paragraph, the processing of the
current configuration file is terminated, and the indicated configuration file
is processed. This allows a concatenation of configuration files.


[ COMMENT ]

These paragraphs are ignored by XKeyb, and are used to insert comments.


[ LIST ]

XKeyb outputs the contents of these paragraphs to the screen, unless output
is supressed by the /Q command-line switch.



5. Improving Storage utilization with XKEYBRES
==============================================
When installed under normal conditions the XKeyb program occupies less memory
than the original MS-DOS keyboard driver. However because of the relatively
large amount of memory necessary to load a configuration file, XKeyb must
allocate far more memory than its DOS counterpart, which can make it difficult
to load XKeyb into upper memory.

To avoid this problem the XKEYRES program was developed. It contains all of the
components of the keyboard driver which remain resident, but only a minimum
of initialisation routines. This program is substantially smaller than XKEYB
and can be installed in a memory block as small as 10KB. The disadvantage of
loading XKEYBRES is that it doesn't load a keyboard definition (i.e. all keys
are undefined and produce no characters).  To prevent the keyboard from being
blocked, the driver remains deactivated (in the same way as pressing
ALT-CTRL-F1 will deactivate XKeyb).

After XKEYBRES has been installed a keyboard definition can be loaded using
the command:

XKEYB <definition file>

This will also automatically switch the keyboard driver into active mode.

Two additional things should be considered before using XKEYBRES:

1. The driver is installed as a memory resident program even if a keyboard
   driver is already installed.
2. The size of the additional storage area for extension strings cannot be
   defined for XKEYBRES (the /Xnn switch for XKeyb). XKEYBRES always reserves
   923 bytes for extension character strings.

An example of using XKEYBRES as the keyboard driver could look like this in
AUTOEXEC.BAT:

@Echo off
...
LH XKEYBRES
XKEYB GR /Q
...



6. PI - the Program Interface of XKeyb. 
========================================

The Program Interface is an interface for other programs, allowing all of the
XKeyb functions to be accessed. Apart from the functions relating to key 
assignment, it also provides functions for extended keyboard inquiry and the
definition of Hotkeys.

The PI is accessed using the multiplexer INTERRUPT (INT 2Fh). The AH register
must contain the value ADh, and the AL register must have the number of the
required function.

The functions of the PI and their applications in detail: 


Installation CHECK (80h)
This function allows the program to determine if XKeyb is resident in memory.

Input:  AX=AD80h 

Output: AL=00h -> No keyboard driver installed. 
        AL=FFh, BX=584Bh -> XKeyb installed, CX=version number 
        BX<>584Bh -> Other keyboard driver (probably KEYB.COM) 


Set keyboard mapping (82h)
This function switches between XKeyb and the BIOS keyboard driver.
(CTRL-ALT-F1 / F2)

Input:  AX=AD82h
        BL=00h -> BIOS keyboard driver
        BL=FFh -> XKeyb

Output: CF=1 -> Error 
        CF=0 -> OK 
                  
The 80h and 82h functions are also available with KEYB.COM, but the following
functions only apply to XKeyb (starting from version 1.20).


Set key translation (90h)
This function sets the output(s) of an individual key (the same as a line in
the [ KEYS ] paragraph of the definition file).

Input:  DI=key number (Scancode of the key) 
        BL=Normal allocation 
        CH=value with SHIFT 
        CL=value with CTRL 
        DH=value with ALT 
        DL=value with ALTGr / CTRL+ALT 
        BH=key status 

Output: AX=0 -> OK 
        AX=4 -> Bad key number 

Note: The allocations are either ASCII values, those the key is to be assigned
      directly, or the numbers of XStrings/XFunctions.

The meaning of the key status bits: 
Bit    Meaning (if bit is set to 1)
---  ------------------------------------------------------------
 0   key with SCROLL LOCK
 1   key with NUM LOCK
 2   key with CAPS LOCK 
 3   key is on level 4 (AltGr/CTRL-ALT), and mapped to an XString
 4   XString/XFunction on level 3 (ALT)
 5   XStrinc/XFunction on level 2 (CTRL)
 6   XString/XFunction on level 1 (SHIFT)
 7   XString/XFunction on level 0 (without everything)


Get key translation (91h)
The query function for function 90h. 

Input:  AX=AD91h 
        DI=key number (Scancode) 

Output: AX=0 -> OK. BX, CX, DX contain the allocations. 
        AX=4 -> Bad key number. 


Wait for key hit (94h)
As the name implies, this function waits until a key is depressed. The
contents of the key buffers are ignored.

Input:  AX=AD94h 

Output: AH=Virtual Scancode 
        BH=Real Scancode 
        AL=ASCII value 
        BL=Key status 
        DH=Key Level (0-4) 

Note: The presence of two Scancodes may appear somewhat confusing. The reason
      is that some keys produce a different Scancode when used with certain
      shift keys (the virtual Scancode). This is the case with the function
      keys (F1-F10) and some of the cursor keys. With the alphanumeric keys
      both Scancodes are the same.
      BL contains the keyboard status from 0:417h and indicates the status of
      the shift keys. DH indicates the key level, from which the ASCII value
      originates.


Put key into buffer (95h)
This function stores a virtual 'key' in the keyboard buffer.

Input:  AX=AD95h 
        BH=Scancode (virtual) 
        BL=ASCII value 

Output: AX=0 -> OK 
        AX=5 -> Buffer full 


Set XString (96h)
with set XString is geandert an extension stringer or again created.

Input:  AX=AD96h 
        BL=XString number (1-200) 
        ES:DI=Pointer to the string 

Output: AX=0 -> OK 
        AX=1 -> Bad XString number 
        AX=2 -> XString memory full 

Note: The first byte of the string must contain the string length (Pascal
      string). Special characters (such as \n or \S072) are NOT interpreted.
      If the XString is to contain keys which do not produce ASCII values
      (like cursor and function keys), then these are indicated by a zero
      byte followed by the virtual Scancode of the key in the string. The
      allocation of the XString:

      'ABC\[F11]DEF\n'

      is thus achieved by the string:

      'ABC'#0#87'DEF'#13.


GET XString (97h)
The query function for function 96h.

Input:  AX=AD97h 
        BL=XString number 
        ES:DI=Address of Buffer for string 

Output: AX=0 -> OK. String is stored at ES:DI. 
        AX=1 -> Bad XString number. 
        AX=3 -> XString is not defined. 


Set XFunction (98h)
This function equivalent to function 96h, except that it defines XFunctions
rather than XStrings.

As with XStrings, XFunctions are assigned to keys, and are assigned to
numbers (XFunctions are reserved the numbers 201 to 240).

If a key is pressed which has an XFunction associated with it, one of 3
things will happen:
1. The function is output immediately
2. The functionis output using INT16 (keyboard BIOS).
3. If the function is not output-driven a flag is set, which indicates
   that the function was activated.

Input:  AX=AD98h 
        BL=XFunction number (0=function code look up) 
        BH=Call  Convention: 0=Output using INT16 
                             1=Output immediately 
                             2=Flag set 
        ES:DI=Address of routine / flag 

Output: AX=0 -> OK. BL = function code. 
        AX=1 -> Bad XFunction number 
        AX=6 -> No function codes free 
        AX=7 -> Invalid call convention 

Note: The indicated routine must be FAR. It receives as a parameter a Word,
      which caontains Scancode of the key in its upper byte and
      and the keyboard status in its lower byte. This allows the routine to
      determine its caller, if it is called from several different keys.

      If BH contains the value 2, then the Word is stored with to activate
      the function with ES:DI. Everything
      else is then thing of the appropriate program. If the indicated routine
      is output-driven immediately (BH=1), is not with the Ausfuhrung the
      hardware INTERRUPTS yet again de-energised (the INTERRUPT CONTROLLER
      has still no EoI received). Therefore the call convention 0 should be
      preferred if moglich. Protecting the Ausfuhrung of the routine is all
      ublichen INTERRUPTS certified. Within the routine it is to be made
      certain that before an access to the own data segment the DS register
      must be set accordingly. Furthermore it recommends to switch if
      necessary to its own stack. Registers DS and BP are to contain the same
      values during the jerk branch, as with the entrance. 


Clear XFunction (99h)
Clears an XFunction definition.

Input:  BL=Number of the XFunction (201-240) 
Output: AX=0 -> OK 
        AX=1 -> Invalid XFunction number 
        AX=8 -> Indicated XFunction is not occupied 


Set translation table address (9Ah)
Sets the address of the keyboard Translation Table.

Input:  ES:DI=Address of the new table 

Output: AX=0 -> OK 

Note: This function allows the administration of several key assignments,
      by switching the Translation Table. Each table consists of 100
      entries, each of which consist of 5 levels of the allocations for and
      the status byte as the last byte of the entry. If a new table is
      selected with this function which is not initialized the keyboard will
      produce random characters.


Get translation table address (9Bh)
Determines the address of the current Translation Table.

Input: AX=AD9Bh 

Output: ES:DI=Address of the Translation Table. 


Get last XString (9Ch)
Determines the number of the last defined XString.

Input: AX=AD9Ch 

Output: BL=Number of the last XString 


GET combination table address (9Dh)
Returns the address of the combination characters table.

The table has the following structure: 

1st entry
    first character of the combination (e.g. ')
    number of following combinations (e.g. 2)
        1st combination second character of the combination (e.g. a)
            resulting character (e.g. ...)
        2nd combination second character of the combination (e.g. i)
            resulting character (e.g. )
2nd entry
...

A zero byte follows the last entry in the table.

The table can be a maximum of 192 bytes long, including the zero byte. 

Input:  AX=AD9Dh 

Output: ES:DI=Address of table. 


Get shift table address (9Eh)
Determines the address of the list with the Scancodes of the shift keys:

SHIFT1 SHIFT2 CTRL ALT SCROLL NUM CAPS INSERT 

Input: AX=AD9E 

Output: ES:DI=Address of table. 



7. Using PI with the unit XKeyb_PI
==================================

XKeyb_PI is a Turbo Pascal unit which allows easy access to the functions
of the Program Interface:

Function TestInstalled : Word;

Procedure XKeybOn(B : Boolean);

Procedure SetKey(KeyNum,Normal,Shift,Control,Alt,AltGr,Status);

Procedure GetKey(Num:Byte;Var Norm,Shift,Ctrl,Alt,AltGr,Status);

Procedure WaitForKey(Var VScan,RScan,Ascii,KeyStat,Ebene:Byte);

Procedure PutKey(Ascii,Scan : Byte);

Procedure SetXStr(Num : Byte; XStr : String);

Procedure GetXStr(Num : Byte; Var XStr : String);

Procedure SetXFunc(Var Num:Byte; CallConv:Byte; Adresse:Pointer);

Procedure ClearXFunc(Num : Byte);

Procedure SetTable(P : Pointer);

Function TableAdr : Pointer;

Function LastXStr : Byte;

Function CombiTabAdr : Pointer;

Function ShiftTabAdr : Pointer;

After reading the previous section the function of these routines should be
reasonably clear. If not, the file XKeyb_PI.PAS contains further information.

At least one of the routines calling these functions must contain the variable
FEHLER to receive the error status:

0 = OK, otherwise error code (see XKeyb_PI.PAS and the PI section for more
                              details)

In addition to these functions (which directly correspond to the functions
of the Program Interface), two additional functions are provided: Enter and
Leave. Both are to be used only within an XFunction routine. 

Enter saves the DS, SS and SP registers, loads DS with the address of the
Turbo Pascal data segment, and adjusts SS:SP to the Turbo Pascal stack.

Leave sets SS:SP and DS to their old values. 

An XFunction routine could then resemble the following: 

Type   KeyTyp = Record
                Stat,Scan : Byte;
                End;
{$F+}  { Routine must be FAR! }
Procedure MyHotkey(Key : Keytyp);
Begin
   Enter;
   DoIt(Key);
   Leave;
End;
{$F-}

When using Enter and Leave the routine may use any global, however NO local
variables. However this applies only to the XFunction routine. All of these
called routines must define any variables they produce and use.



8. Using the macro recorder KeyMan
==================================

Another program included with XKeyb is KEYMAN.EXE. KeyMan is a simple macro
recorder which is installed as a memory resident program that allows simple
(re)definition of keys.

KeyMan can only be loaded if XKeyb already is already resident in memory. It
is activated by a Hotkey (F11 by default). After activation KeyMan will pop up
a window on the display. Now you can either press a key to which you want to
assign a new macro, or press the Hotkey again to redefine it.

If you pressed a key which already had a macro assigned to it, the current
macro will be printed in the window. This macro can be edited by using the
BACKSPACE key to erase the displayed keystrokes (to include a BACKSPACE
keystroke as part of the macro, press ALT and "8" on the numeric keypad).
After pressing the Hotkey again the macro will be allocated and the window
wil disappear.

Note: If the key you pressed did NOT already have a macro assigned to it,
      that key will be defaulted as the first keystroke of the macro
      (i.e. if you pressed CTRL-D, the macro will initially consist of the
      keystroke "CTRL-D").

If the new macro consisted of more than one character, an XString will be
automatically created and assigned to the key (if enough XString space was
allocated via the /Xnn switch when XKeyb was installed).

If you pressed the Hotkey after the activation of KeyMan, KeyMan will ask you
to press the new Hotkey. After pressing a key the window will disappear and
the key pressed will become the new Hotkey.

If you want to save an interactively created key allocation, then you can do
this by using the command

LISTXDEF >xyz.KEY


9. Using the extended scancode keys
====================================

On newer AT keyboards, some of the keys produce an additional extended E0
scancode, that preceeds the proper scancode of the key. These keys were
originally the new gray keys duplicating the functionality of the numeric pad
of the XT keyboards.

However, with time some other keys were added, being all of them preceeded by
the E0 scancode, as for example the Windows keys, and the newest multimedia keys.

XKEYB supports these keys, as explained in section 4. The following is a brief
guide of some of the most popular key bindings. The following are hexadecimal codes
of the scancode that appears after the E0 extended scancode.

Please, do remember that the number in [KEYS] section must be specified in
decimal.

  files have been patched to support this
- The Extended (E0h) keys no longer behave as those of the numpad
  with respect to NumLock and SHIFT
- Comments on the source file translated into English
- SCANKBD is not more command-line friendly, and the RTE200 is
  patched within the makefile
- Contributed: PC860 (Standard, 860 codepage)

- Removed: PC8, RU, ECMA


Version 1.9:

- Fixed the bug with Alt+9 key combination
- Added comments with ; inside the code
- Control is passed to the next handler of the 2Fh chain for ALL the
  non-supported functions, namely 83..8F, 92, 93, 9D..FF

  level, instead of ASCII recognition. (user defined XFunctions are now
  200..235

into buffer; StoreKey simply parses any possible ASCII,Scancode to its
corresponding action.
- Xfunction 249: Break interrupt (for ctrl+break)
- Changes of virtual ScanCode moved into StoreKey
- API function 94h: AH=BH=ScanCode, no longer separation between real and
virtual scancode
