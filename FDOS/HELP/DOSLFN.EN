| DOSLFN - A Real-mode driver for Long File Names missed in DOS |
|	   With full Unicode and DBCS support!			|
+---------------------------------------------------------------+

APPROACH

Of course I needed such a program since 1996, but in mind that such a tool
is useful for everybody, I thought someone would write it. And so I was
idle and waiting, and last year I found some tools, e.g. LFNDOS.EXE,
written 1998, not so old as expected.

This program was written for functionality with Win9x COMMAND.COM,
and doesn't work with my favourite file manager, Volkov Commander.
(You cannot go into directories with a long name.) And that TSR is so
S_L_O_W, and, on the other hand, consumes 64 KB of memory, too much!
This program cannot create files and directories with lower case letters
(Why??), there is no way to go away from snakes (tildes, according to
the registry key NameNumericTail=0), and, last not least, it doesn't
supports umlauts correctly.


MY TRY:

Of course, such a program must be written in assembly language.
With the nice Turbo Assembler I used the not-so-commonly used IDEAL mode
to enable local structure components, among other advantages (e.g. speed).
This program is dedicated to not to have the bugs found in the ones as
stated above. And I would support long names on CD (Joliet), very useful
for restoring backups under plain DOS. A reasonable good tool for this is
ODI's LFN tools, but that's not a driver.

Important at least to me is usefulness in conjunction with Volkov Commander,
the best Norton Commander clone I think. Among it supports long filenames,
it is much smaller and faster than the original, and has some nice features.
(Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages, like missing hotkeys for
 directory sorting, or a computer link feature.)

While programming I must state that's not so easy to write a bullet-proof
driver with at most full functionality as I'm thought at a glance.
No wonder that I found such one not earlier - and so hard to program.

At first, an objective was to consume as least as possible memory, around
4 KB. Now, I'm far, far away from this goal, and I'm happy with less than
12 KB. Compared with 64K this is good enough.

Another hurdle was understanding Windows9x long filename semantics. What
"cd .." should be, is commonly known, "cd ..." is new with 9x and changes
two directory levels up, "cd ...." three and so forth. (I was familiar with
the fact that the directory entries "." and ".." are not directly used by
DOS.) Or the way pattern matching with long filenames is done: some is
known from UNIX (like *1 matches all files ending with "1"), some is Win32
specific, like "*." that matches all files WITHOUT an extension.
And, an extension is defined as the part after the LAST dot not in a
chain of first dots. Or that's possible to create files with leading
spaces and/or dots, but trailing spaces and/or dots were truncated.
With "*." in mind, this is necessary, because there is no way to find files
with a dot at end. Therefore, filenames with spaces and dots alone are not
allowed, with the virtual exception of useless "." and ".." directory entries.
COMMAND.COM uses the DOS function Get Extended Error Information, and so I
had to use the unhandy complementary function to set this error code, to
put COMMAND.COM to work correctly.


THE SWITCHES EXPLAINED:

~ (tilde usage): By default, Win9x adds a "~1" designator to the alias of
  any long file name, "~2" if there is a clash, and so on.
  Therefore, these long file names in plain DOS cannot address the alias.
  This behaviour seems to be built in due to erraneous behaviour of
  some tested software. (I guess, it was some old Microsoft software.)

  For normal DOS & Win users, this is impractical. Plain DOS is able to
  "support" long names by automatically truncating them to 8.3 form.
  Unless name contains spaces or multiple dots, the same long name can
  address a file both with and without available LFNs. Users can maintain
  compatibility for some program configuration independently whether running
  {Win9x or DOSLFN} or not.

  You can switch off tilde usage in Win9x by adding following binary key:
	REGEDIT4
	[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\control\FileSystem]
	"NameNumericTail"=hex:00
  Then you have to restart Windows. (Dont't forget to hold down the "shift"
  key when you confirm selecting "restart"; it is not necessary to reboot.)
  
  You may also refer the WWW with keyword "NameNumericTail".

t (tunnel effect): This feature, built in Win9x file system, help long
  file names to survive when modifying files with a conventional (8.3)
  text editor or comparable tool. They replace files as follows:
  * delete a file <alias>.bak (if any)
  * rename the original file <alias>.txt to <alias>.bak
  * create a new file <alias>.txt

  With this sequence, the long file name will be lost forever.
  But with "tunnel effect" active, Win9x and DOSLFN will watch for
  delete-rename-create (DRC) sequences and "automagically" attach previously
  deleted long file name entries to newly created names, if the <alias>
  is the same.
  The DRC sequence above may also be truncated to DR, DC, RR, or RC,
  and works for directories too.
  As documented in MSDN CD, Win9x internal "tunnel info" is kept 15 seconds,
  however, I can't find any obliviousness. Also, tunneling in Win9x works
  in both "directions", it remembers the alias if an LFN aware program
  does the same procedure. Therefore, you cannot get rid of "~" in "PROGRA~1"
  if you just rename "Program Files" to "Programs" and back.
  (You can restart Windows between two renamings to get desired effect.)

  Furthermore, as required in a multi-tasked OS, Win9x has more than one
  "tunnel info", allowing two or more processes (Win16 or DOS programs)
  make such DRC sequences at the same time or interleaved in one process.
  For simplicity, DOSLFN will only support one "tunnel info".

c (CDROM support): Enables CDROM support, i.e. DOSLFN uses much more memory
  to keep code for CDROM initialization and CDROM access. This switch defaults
  to the state whether SHSUCDX v3.01 is loaded or not (this version of DOSLFN
  does not work with MSCDEX or earlier versions of SHSUCDX). You must include
  a c+ switch if you load DOSLFN before SHSUCDX, and you want long file names
  on CDROM!

i (InDOS flag usage): For supporting TSR programs that use LFNs, they need
  to know whether DOSLFN is still working or not. Even worse, working with
  short file names can lead to data trash if DOSLFN removes unused LFNs
  or adds LFNs by tunneling (see -t switch).
  The odds of InDOS flag usage are that while DOSLFN calls OldInt21,
  the InDOS flag rises to 2. I don't know better bullet-proof solution to
  keep InDOS flag nonzero _and_ call DOS.
  If you get in trouble, you may switch it off. On is the default.

z DOSLFN must convert Unicode to local code page, and this is locale
  dependent. Because DOS (or NLSFUNC) has no such a table built-in,
  this table must be delivered to DOSLFN.
  Nineteen Unicode translation tables, e.g. for 437 (Standard IBM, for
  resetting purpose), 850 (Western Europe), 852 (Eastern Europe), 866
  (cyrillic), and two for Greek are now bundled with DOSLFN.
  A code page can be loaded/changed even while DOSLFN is resident.
  Most European users use umlauts very seldom (due to known problems
  with bad-coded software[*] around the world), therefore, a forgotten
  code table load is not critical. But if you see filenames with
  unexpected underlines, you should load the code table.
  (DOSLFN does simply convert non-convertible unicodes to "_", without
   any notification on now equal file names.)
  Hint: DOSLFN loads the "right" unicode table automatically on startup,
  therefore, you don't need this switch even in East European countries.
  Furthermore, DOSLFN loads a table automatically if you change the code
  page using DOS' NLSFUNC, but you may have to reserve extra heap
  (Japanese DOS must include /m18000 if they load DOSLFN while in US mode).

  [*] Often, it is wicked Unix software (e.g. "tar") that kills umlauts.
  Unix is internally more a 7 bit OS rather than 32 bit, and this limitation
  is spreaded into world until recent (brain-dead UTF-7, MIME codings...)

m DOSLFN needs an internal heap for storing data; mostly, for Find Handles.
  The size of this data area defaults to 1000 Bytes.
  Smaller values reduce the memory consumption of resident DOSLFN.
  This switch cannot be given while DOSLFN is resident; the memory may be
  in use.

m[sln] Specify the maximum size of the shortname path (80), longname path
  (260) and filename (256). Note that even though DOS will not change into
  an extra-long path, it can still be specified explicitly, so the default
  value of 80 might not be enough. See MVALUES, below.

l DOSLFN is bilingual. If it detects a locale of Austria, Switzerland,
  or Germany, it defaults to German language, English otherwise.
  To override language defaulting, use "ld" for German or "le" for English.
  e.g. get English help in Austria with "doslfn -le -h" or "doslfn leh"
  (As you see, DOSLFN ignores switch prefixes and spaces.
   A trailing whitespace is only necessary for the z command.)
  While DOSLFN is resident, the language override is permanent.

o Timezone offset. If no timezone is given, TZ will be re-read. See below.

TZ Timezone environment variable - to convert FAT time
  stamp to Win32 time format (an Int64 in 100ns steps past 1.1.1601).
  The format is [NAME]H[:MM] where NAME is an optional abbreviation,
  H is hours and MM is optional minutes. The number expresses distance
  from GMT (Greenwich) - positive is behind, negative is ahead.
  A daylight savings time (DST) cannot be used because of unknown
  calculation method for so many countries. If wanted so, DOSLFN must
  have knowledge for all DST rules in the past (and future) for
  given country, to convert file times according to its dates, not to
  current date (most programs seems to have this bug). Using American
  DST rule is not applicable, although most programs do so.
  Therefore, I suggest that users should set the TZ variable, e.g. for
  Central Europe:
	set TZ=MET-1		in winter
	set TZ=MET-2		in summer
  not using any DST info - but they have to change their AUTOEXEC.BAT
  twice a year.

  TZ is not necessary for converting CDFS to Win32 time format
  because dates on it contain information about time zone distance
  (a byte in 15min steps) for the country where the CD is created.
  However, to maintain equal world time, converting CDFS times to
  FAT time (as return value for almost all time functions), both
  TZ and CDFS time zone info must be put together to calculate correct
  FAT (=always local) time - so it's better to step internally through
  Win32 time format.

** If profiling is enabled **

p Display the profile data - number of calls, time in seconds, description.

pr Reset the profile data - number of calls and time are set to zero.

pc Calibrate your profile timing constant. Profiling makes use of the Pentium
  Read Timestamp Counter (RDTSC) instruction for timing. Unless you happen to
  have a 2.6GHz P4 you will need to re-compile DOSLFN with your constant.


ACTIONS:

Action letters must stay at the end of a command line, because command line
parsing ends there.

The default action is to load DOSLFN or to activate and show a short message,
saying that DOSLFN is already loaded and active.

Unloading DOSLFN may fail if there is a TSR hooking Int21 or 2F above DOSLFN.
If so, DOSLFN disables itself, but remains in memory until another
action (like unloading or re-enabling). You have to unload this (or these)
above TSR(s) first. If that's impossible (mostly: Microsoft shit),
you have to "simply reboot your system".


SOME NOTES ON IMPLEMENTATION:

A big trouble to me is safe support for long names on CD. Because I want
to build on top of MSCDEX, I have to make bridges between Joliet and ISO,
and I found, there are no safe bridges! (WinOnCD burns such a Link Table,
it's nice to me, but that isn't a standard.)
Windows 9x and NT "invent" new short file names and don't use the ISO part
of Joliet CDs at all, furthermore, these two systems have different rules.
So, if you put a CD with long file names into a drive and look on it with
an old DOS program, you'll find up to three different short names for a
long name under bare DOS, Windows9x and WindowsNT.
As ODI's LFN tools doesn't require MSCDEX (except for reading sectors),
it has no problem with it, a driver should deliver right short names
for the long ones, because MSCDEX should handle the short ones.

Previous versions of DOSLFN loaded a file which provided the link between
the Joliet name and its ISO counterpart. This version no longer supports
MSCDEX, instead using SHSUCDX v3, which uses the Joliet system itself (and
yet another method for generating short names).

Another trouble are Write accesses and the consistency of sector buffers:
I want to cache data, but a ShortName API may change disk content;
so I have to discard all caches, at least for this drive, at every
DOS directory write access, even the old FCB ones.
This degrades DOSLFN's performance.
To support as many DOS versions as possible (not only MS), I don't want
to use undocumented internal DOS structures.


CHECKED FUNCTIONAL UNDER:

* MS Windows NT 4 DOS-Box, FAT12 and FAT16 drives
  (but you should take NTLFN package, also nice open-source Freeware)
* MS-DOS 6.2
* MS-DOS 7.10, FAT32
* DR-DOS 7, with a magneto-optical drive


THAT DOESN'T YET WORK:

* JOINed drives (but SUBSTed drives work)
* ASSIGNed drives (not tested, because similar to SUBST it should work later)
* Windows 3.11 with enabled 32 bit file access forces DOSLFN to its FallBack
  mode for your hard disk(s) because VCACHE.386 prevents direct disk access
  via Int25/26 and Int21/AH=32. Please disable the "32 bit file access".
  (You can leave the "32 bit disk access" on.)


THAT WILL PROBABLY NEVER WORK:

* functions around SUBST, AL=AAh	("query subst" is available)
* file creation from server, AL=A9h
* retrieve handle information, AL=A6h
* reset drive, AL=0Dh


HINT FOR DBCS (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, =CJK) USERS:

Simply load DOSLFN as a western user - but DOSLFN consumes much more
memory to hold the larger DBCS<->Unicode table.

 SOME BACKGROUND:
When booting from an Win9x/Me Emergency Disk, DOS reports a code page of 932,
936, 949, or 950, but the display font is yet the BIOS' 437.
Furthermore, the DOS internal DBCS Lead Byte table is not yet activated.
Therefore, you see garbage when you list file names containing Chinese
Characters, regardless of using DOSLFN.
After starting PDOS95.BAT, I suppose, the display is switched to a 40x24
full-width (square shaped) Chinese character graphics mode (with half-width
katakana between if you use CP932=Japanese Shift-JIS). The 25. line is for the
Input Method Editor (IME), merely a Romaji/Pinyin input and Kanji/Kanxi
selection line. (Selection is necessary due to the fact that more characters
with different meanings exist for one spelling, especially in Japanese.)
Furthermore, the DOS internal DBCS Lead Byte table is activated, and DOSLFN
should then convert all Unicodes in LFNs to DBCS and vice versa when writing.
Due to availability of a Mainland Chinese user (and I who understand Japanese),
future testings are limited to CP932 and CP936. (CP950 reportedly works yet.)
Note that there are much better replacement tools for the PDOS95.BAT,
I had the "TechWay SCS V3.2" program/driver available (thanks 2 wengier),
which runs under German DOS6 too. One of its advantage is automatic
detection of widely-used box drawing symbols and not to interpret them
as Chinese characters (as PDOS95.BAT will do). Therefore, I could run
my favorite file manager (vc.com), editor (turbo.exe) and debugger (td.exe)
with almost no annoyances.


PROGRAMS "DOSLFNMS", "MVALUES", "MK_TABLE", AND "LOWDMA":

DOSLFNMS is intended for use with MS-DOS 7 (but may also work with FreeDOS)
and also has some features removed to reduce its size:
- doesn't disable itself when starting Windows;
- doesn't recognise codepage changes;
- doesn't handle double-byte character sets.

MVALUES can be used to scan your drives to find the optimum sizes for the m
switches. This could save over a ¬K from the resident size. It only accepts
one parameter, which is a string of drives to scan (default is C).

MK_TABLE converts a Unicode table (ASCII form), downloadable at
www.unicode.org, into binary Volkov Commander form used by DOSLFN.

LOWDMA: see LOWDMA.TXT

 Following changes and bugfixes are inspired by jadoxa@yahoo.com.au but
 he has much more done:
* minor code optimizations
- setting ReadOnly attribute when creating SFN file with Tunnel effect
* Sector access goes through (undocumented) SmartDrive cache, improves
  performance like shown when copying some files from C:
  without DOSLFN	25 s copy to A:		7 s delete from A:
  with DOSLFN 0.32n	78 s copy to A:		12 s delete from A:
  with DOSLFN 0.32o	43 s copy to A:		7 s delete from A:
* MKLINK can now handle directories larger than 64KB (rare, not tested)
* MKLINK.PAS can compile to a DPMI version for more memory usage (tested)

Following versions are all by Jason Hood:

Version 0.32o, first jh release (10/03)
* various size optimisations;
* modified generation of CD short names, SHSUCDX 2.0 tilde generation;

+ read lowercase names generated by XP
- flush dirty sectors before changing drive
- fixed bug where "path not found" should be "file not found"
- prevent loading DBCS tables if not using DBCS
- better fallback mode support (network drives & non-Joliet CDs):
  - get/set modification time work; all others fail, not erroneously succeed
  - delete wildcards
  - Volume Information (71A0) returns unknown filesystem ("?")
- fixed bug with rename corrupting memory (crashed COMMAND.COM)
- return error 1 (invalid subfunction) for invalid attrib/truename/alias/time
- fail all attribute functions for devices
- free the previous link table if loading a Rock-Ridge CD
- fixed memory allocation size (filling the heap would crash DOS) & display
- SFN to create, but LFN to use (eg: SFN MkDir, LFN ChDir, DOSLFN would not
  see the new dir.); may still be problems with Create Temporary File (5A)
- Volume Information returns "FAT32" if appropriate
- remove the hidden file created when a directory couldn't be expanded
* prevent free space from having to be recalculated (DOSLFNMS)

Source:

+ conditional compiles:

    USEOLDDOS	enable LFN filtering on DOS find functions
    USEWINTIME	enable real Win <-> DOS filetime conversions
    USEXP	enable reading of XP lowercase 8.3 names
    USEFREESPC	enable setting of the DPB free cluster count
    PROFILE	enable profiling (requires & assumes Pentium)
    PROFILECACHE enable profiling of fastopen cache (also requires above)
    PATHLOOK	see what's (not) being cached

* removed DT_BIGDOS, added DT_FAT12 and swapped positions of DT_FAT16/32
  (DT_FAT?? is the number of nibbles per entry - size optimisation);
  DT_DrvPar is now only used by CD (distinguishes Rock-Ridge from Joliet)
* fixed some comments, removed some commented code
* install the shortname entry directly (PF_Install_Short)
* size optimisations, including:
  * most CD code is now overwritten if CD support is not required
  * use only extended or standard DPB/disk functions
  * assume alias numbers (both DOSLFN & SHSUCDX) are < 2560
  * patch code directly instead of TESTing [ctrl]
* read 4 FAT sectors at a time (2K buffer)
* new fastopen cache (caches 16 directories and 16 names, across all drives)
* get/set attribute uses directory entry (faster than using DOS)
* CDs always use sector 16 as volume start (this is all SHSUCDX does)
- fixed printf bug with signed numbers (was using CX, not ECX)
+ p switch to display profile data
+ pr switch to reset profile data
+ pc switch to calibrate profile timing (recompile with this value)
* trying to use a file as a directory will immediately fail (this replaces the
  FindFirst directory attribute test)
* modified heap to use byte-sized allocations, extending the allocation if
  there are 1, 2 or 3 bytes left over; removed allocation strategy
* Alloc_Cluster creates its own directory entry

Version 0.33a (07/04)
- get the attribute of the root directory

Version 0.33b (07/04)
- delete all wildcards, not just the first

Version 0.34 (11/04) (MSCDEX)
- fixed -r
- removed 2560 number limit
* CD: volume label will be found irrespective of given path
* CD: removed SHSUCDX code
* CD: removed Rock Ridge support

Version 0.40 (11/04) (SHSUCDX v3)
* CD: this version requires SHSUCDX v3 for Joliet support!
* CD: improved Rock Ridge support (no longer requires "LINUX" system ID)
+ CD: added long ISO name support
* CD: -r defaults to same as SHSUCDX

Version 0.40a (03/05)
- fixed cache problem with attribute functions (FreeDOS bug 1818)
- fixed compile problems with TASM 5.3
- fixed FAT mkdir/rename/del straight after CD access
+ added Joliet support for SHSUCDX 3.01
- L: fixed problem with dir on Windows

Version 0.40b (10/05)
- fixed cache causing crash when heap was low (particular problem with MPXPLAY)
- fixed CD problems (installing from CD, certain programs not working)

Version 0.40c (11/05)
- fixed setting creation time when file created
- fixed more CD problems (incorrectly coded directory lengths, finding path,
  /c- option when CD was available)
- fixed failing to find files due to NULs stored in the directory entry
* CD: improved recognition of long ISO names

Remaining known bugs:
- no setting/updating "last access" date
- no setting/removing LFN DirEnts when calling FCB functions
- VCACHE.386 bug, you must disable 32bit file access in Windows 3.11
- LFN DRIVER LOAD ORDER bug - NTFSDOS must be loaded after DOSLFN
- no VERSION CHECK - strange behaviour when using different DOSLFN versions
- TRUENAME doesn't handle devices correctly
- creating a *really* long name on a 512-byte cluster (allocating a second
  cluster will fail; other cluster sizes will always have enough room).
- changing disk (or formatting, resizing a RAM disk) will not reset the cache
  for that drive. This may cause DOSLFN to think a file/dir still exists.
  Workaround: fill the cache with entries from another drive (eg: attrib /s).
- deactivating may make CDs' current directory invalid (it's equivalent to
  putting in another disc).
- NIOS' internal commands don't work (this is a problem with NIOS & MS-DOS 7).
  Workaround: add an invalid drive to the PATH.
- appending a backslash after a filename will not find that file (but it's ok
  for a directory).
- NTFSDOS sometimes gives incorrect times - this is a bug in NTFSDOS.
