Grand Theft Auto - Installation Problems

24 Bit Version
--------------
If your computer starts up in the 24 bit version of the game with fuzzy
looking graphics, try re-selecting the screen mode from the F11 menu. This
should cure this problem.

High colour GTA uses a built-in version of the "univbe" display driver to
provide its multitude of 15, 16 and 32-bit display modes. If your video card
is not recognised by the univbe check, or if you change your video card and
the check does not update to it, try running uvconfig.exe in the gtados
directory. If that doesn't work, try running 24-bit GTA by typing
"gta24 -nounivbe" in the gtados directory. This will cause it to skip univbe
and use your video card's native drivers instead. Alternatively, get hold of
thelatest version of univbe from SciTech Software, and run it as a TSR before
running GTA.

Windows Drivers ( Grand Theft Auto DirectX )
---------------
GTA DirectX will only work correctly if you have the latest Windows 95 Direct
X Microsoft-certified driver for your video card. Your video card vendor
should be able to supply this.

Some of the latest versions of drivers will allow the use of
High colour / Low resolution screen modes (recommended). An example of this
is the Matrox Millenium.

Gravis Ultrasound
-----------------

The DOS version of GTA, run under Windows95, will not play any
sound effects with an Ultrasound, UNLESS you shut down windows into MS-DOS
mode, or change the PIF from DOS-Box to MS-DOS mode.

DOS Version - CD Sound
----------------------
To allow CD audio to play on the DOS version of GTA, when run under a
bootable version of DOS, make sure that you have the MSCDEX driver loaded. 
On a Windows 95 machine, if you play the DOS version through Windows, or
in a DOS box, you should get CD audio.

Sidewinder Control Pad - In DOS GTA
-----------------------------------
The Microsoft Sidewinder pad is not compatible with DOS GTA. However, it
can be used with Windows (DirectX) GTA.

3DFX version
------------
3DFX GTA is compatible with Voodoo 3DFX cards ( e.g. Diamond Monster,
Orchid Righteous ) However, it is not currently compatible with the latest
Rush 3DFX cards ( e.g. Hercules Stingray ). This willhopefully be corrected
soon, and a patch should be available on the DMA or BMG web site.

Note that we recommend 32MB of RAM to run 3DFX GTA.

EMM386 (DOS)
------------
In DOS 6.22, If you have the line DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE in your CONFIG.SYS,
play GTA, quit then press Ctrl-Alt-Del to reset the machine, you may find
that the keyboard does not respond any more.

Using DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE instead should solve this problem.
