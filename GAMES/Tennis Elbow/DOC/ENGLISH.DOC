                        Joystick/mouse          Keyboard
                        -----------------/-----------------
        b1 =            Left Button      /      ALT
        b2 =            Right Button     /      CTRL 
        up/down =       movement of      /      Up arrow
                        your mouse or    /      Down arrow
                        joystick         /

b1 = normal strike              b2 = secured strike
b1+b2 = acceleration            b1 + up = short ball
b2 + up = slice                 b1 + down = lift
b2 + down = defended lob        b1+b2+up = drop shot
b1+b2+down = fighting lob

Up and down are inverted when you control the player who is on the top of the
screen.


How we are playing?
*******************

.Move and strike:
-----------------

With a joystick or mouse:

     When you do not press a button, swirl the Joystick in all directions
to run where you want, or move your mouse in all directions. 
     When you push on a button, your player move slowly to the ideal
position, more you push the Joystick on the left (or the right), more the
ball will go to the left (or the right).
-==>> You must maintain the button pushed when you strike the ball <<==-
When you do not give a special direction, the ball goes to the center on the
opposite ground.
	At the volley, when the ball passes away from your player, push on
a button (any of them) so that he will jump toward the ball.

     To do a crossed strike in the opposite direction of your run, stop
your run before you strike.
     It means that you have to stop pressing the button (or the stick)
which allows to run, before you press the button (or the buttons) which
commands the strike.


With a keyboard:

     To move your player, you can use the arrow keys or the keys you
determined during the setup.
     If you try to move your player while you hit the ALT or CTRL keys,
he will not move att all!


.Service:
---------
	The service is executed with the same method than the other strikes,
with the difference that whatever is the buttons combination, a push-up causes
a slice and a push-down causes a lift. You can move your player to the left
or to the right so you can find a special angle for your service. The
quicklier the ball leaves your racket, the greater the imprecision will be:
- at 175 km/h: the imprecision is negligible
- at 195 km/h: the imprecision is of 15 cm
- at 215 km/h: the imprecision is of 30 cm

.Score:
-------
	Player 1's score is written in the up slots of the score
blackboard, and player 2's score is written in the down slots. If the
little ball is in the up slot, then player 1 serves, otherwise player 2
will serve.

.Ball Trace:
------------
	In the Very Easy, Easy and Medium Difficulties (option in the World
tournaments or when playing a quick game against a CPU player), the impact of
the ball on the ground during the service is marked before the ball hits the
ground in order to help you with your next strike.
	In the Very Easy and Easy difficulties, the impact of the ball on the
ground during the exchanges is also marked earlier to help you.


During the game:
****************

- Esc: Exit to previous menus.
- P:   Pause - strike again P to return to the game.
- F1:  Swap to the Replay mode;
       In this mode, there are 9 different speeds, you have to press on the

     With the Joystick, a push and a laxity:
     to left: go to previous speed, if the 1 is currently on, goes to the
	      the beginning of the replay;
     to right: go to next speed, if th 9 is currently on, goes to the end of
	       the replay;

Characteristics' Influence:
***************************
- Fore Hand, Back Hand, Fore Volley, Back Volley and Smash:
	.the highest the percentage is, the strongest the player strikes

- Service:            Success          Max Speed (also in Mph/h in the game)
	  0% =>  b1:     50%            150 Km/h
		 b2:    100%            120 Km/h
		 b1+b2:  25%            190 Km/h

	  25% => b1:    100%            150 Km/h
		 b2:    100%            126 Km/h
		 b1+b2:  25%            190 Km/h

	  50% => b1:    100%            175 Km/h
		 b2:    100%            132 Km/h
		 b1+b2:  25%            190 Km/h

	  75% => b1:    100%            175 Km/h
		 b2:    100%            138 Km/h
		 b1+b2:  75%            190 Km/h

	 100% => b1:    100%            175 Km/h
		 b2:    100%            145 Km/h
		 b1+b2:  75%            215 Km/h

- The higher the percentage of "Form" is,
	    . the faster the player will run
	    . the faster the player will start running
	    . the further the player will jump at the volley

  The player will be able to do:
  Form: from 0% to 20%      =>      2 acc
	    21% to 41%      =>      3 acc
	    42% to 62%      =>      4 acc
	    63% to 83%      =>      5 acc
	    84% to 100%     =>      6 acc
  "acc" represents the accelerations + fighting lobs

- Player's style:
	.Defender: can do as many fighting lobs as he wants
		   and has 1 extra accelaration
	.Puncher:  has 2 extra accelerations
	.Varied:   has 1 extra acceleration and do medium jumps at the volley
	.Volleyer: do big jumps at the volley

- Skill:
	.for human players:
		all: sees all ball impacts before the ball hits the ground
		service: sees ball impacts before the ball hist the ground at
			 the service.
		none: doesn't see any ball impacts early
	.for CPU players: rules the overall computer force


Statistics screen:
******************
	This screen shows the player's strike strength, and the number
of striked balls, the number of inside balls, and the player's success
percentage; we can also see the number of aces, the number of double faults,
and the running distance.
	The player's rank only appears in a tournament. The strength
percentage at the right of "Second Service" indicates the player's form
strength.
	If you access to this screen during a warm-up/training or a match, the
statistics displayed concern only the current party; if you access it via the
player menu, the statistics concern the whole player career.


Double:
*******
	During a double, player nø1 will team up with player nø3, and player
nø2 will team up with player nø4. You should thus define four players before
you start a game otherwise the computer will pick up the default ones.

* 4. Keys & Known problems *
*****************************

Default keys:
*************
- keyboard 1:
up: arrow up or '8'
down:   down or '2'
left:   left or '4'
right: right or '6'
button 1: 'Left Alt'

Known problems:
***************
- With a Flystick Pro from CH Products, you can push on 2 buttons at the same
  time; so push the hat to left to have the good effect;
- To check your Joystick, launch 'JOY.EXE'; hit a key to exit;
- The animation may be very bad on a PC without a VLB or PCI card: it is
  possible that the game runs with less frames or even worse (normally, it
  runs at 60 frames per second); the CPU power is secondary, the CPU time
  used is almost the same on a 486dx33 and a 486dx2-66;
- If you encounter display problems on your video card, launch UNIVBE.EXE or
  UNIVESA.EXE before you launch TENNIS.EXE;
- If the quality of the game seems to be poor, try to change the detail level 
  pushing on F9, and verify that the video card frequency in 640*480 is 60 hz.
- When you end a match, to go back to the main menu, press ESC.

Music:
*********
If you install Tennis Elbow on your hard drive and then launch the game while 
you have an audio CD in the CDROM drive, TENNIS ELBOW will play this audio CD 
instead of the game music. To modify this, you should read "DATA\cdtracks.txt"
