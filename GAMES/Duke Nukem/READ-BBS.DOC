          The following descriptions should be used as a guideline if
            you wish to put this game on your favorite BBS.  Thanks!


                               SHORT DESCRIPTION:
             Duke Nukum is an arcade/adventure game like none ever
         seen on an IBM PC.  It features huge four-way, dual-scrolling
             playfields with realistic graphics, and animation that
          updates 48 frames per second!  Over 1Meg of total graphics.
             Duke is an amazing hero, who does flips and clings to
            ceilings.  Help him save the world on his first action-
                               packed adventure.

           Other features include:  Large animated enemies, built-in
             hint mode, joystick support, self-running demo, arcade
                  sound effects, save/restore, and much more.


                               FULL DESCRIPTION:
           After the tremendous response to Commander Keen, Apogee's
             follow-up game had to be really spectacular.  And Duke
           Nukum is just that--a superb showstopper with over one Meg
           of animation and graphics, four times more than Commander
                                   Keen had!

             This is an arcade/adventure game that compares to the
            Sega Genesis home systems.  (It's far superior to games
                  typically seen on the Nintendo home system.)

            Duke Nukum also has four-way, dual scrolling playfields,
             and does it better than any other IBM game.  Features:
              Large animated characters, reflections, arcade sound
                 effects, built-in hint mode, joystick support,
                  cinematic sequences, self-running demo mode,
                        save/restore, high scores, etc.

            Rarely is a game released with such a well animated main
           character.  Duke Nukum does realistic somersaults and uses
          his grappling hooks to hand-walk along ceilings.  Duke is a
                            hero everyone will like.

        Duke Nukum is rendered in vivid EGA graphics, with many special
           screen effects.  As usual, Apogee offers two more episodes
            if players want to continue their adventures with Duke.

            This is truly a game that will demonstrate the graphical
            abilities of your computer if you have EGA or VGA.  Get
             ready for a fun time as you rescue the world from the
                           latest madman, Dr. Proton.

          Hardware Requirements:  IBM PC or compatible with 640k RAM,
                       hard drive, and optional joystick.

                     This game is NOT crippled in any way.
