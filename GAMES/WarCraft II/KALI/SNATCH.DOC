Description: Automagic IP Address Snatcher for use with KALI. Useful only
             to dial-up Internet users that have different IP Addresses 
             with every call. In other words, this is for lazy forgetful
             people who need something to edit the WATTCP.CFG file for them.

How to use :   
             SNATCH 
             or
             SNATCH [first.3.digits]

             You must have an existing WATTCP.CFG file. SNATCH will read
             the first 3 digits from the   my_ip = X.X.X.X   line and
             use them as the basis for it's search. Once your IP address is
             found, SNATCH will replace the old address with the newly found
             one.  
   
             If SNATCH finds a parameter, it will use it as the search
             basis rather than the one in the WATTCP.CFG file.

             Add SNATCH.EXE to your batch file that calls the PPP.EXE file
             Place SNATCH in your KALI directory.

             example batch file:
             -   
             PPP <parameters>
             SNATCH 
             KALI <parameters>
