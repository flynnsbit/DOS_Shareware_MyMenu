                          Introduction

Most games only support IPX networks and modem/direct serial link
play; TCP/IP networks are not natively supported.  With the right
software, however, most games designed to be played over IPX LANs
can be fooled into operating over the Internet.  Kali uses the UDP
protocol to send game information between multiple machines on the
Internet.  Kali has been used to play Descent, Doom, Doom II,
Heretic, Hexen, Command & Conquer, Apache, Rise of the Triad,
Terminal Velocity, Warcraft, VR Pool, Super Karts, Mortal Combat 3,
and other games over the Internet with opponents from all over the
world (not all games will be fast enough from modem connections).


                   Getting Prepared - Hardware

To use Kali, you will need the following hardware:

* If your site is directly connected to the Internet (NOT connected
through a modem!), you'll need a network interface card (NIC) for
your machine. And not just any old NIC, mind you - your NIC must be
supported by a packet driver if you wish to use it to play Internet
games.  Usually this means that your NIC must be an ethernet card,
although Kali has been successfully played over token ring.  We
will assume that your PC is already equipped with a suitable NIC,
although it may currently be in use for some other non-TCP/IP
function (such as a node on a Novell network).  As long as your NIC
is supported by a standard packet driver, your machine can be
readily converted into a Kali "playstation."

* If you are not directly connected, you'll need a high speed modem
(the faster the better) as well as an account with an ISP (Internet
Service Provider) which has suitable dialup facilities.

NOTE: Users with "shell accounts" or who use SLIP emulators such as
TIA and SLiRP can also use Kali. See the section "Using Kali with
a shell account."   
        
*If you're currently using SLIP or PPP, but your drivers operate
from under Microsoft Windows (such as Trumpet Winsock), you MUST
obtain a DOS SLIP or PPP driver; your Windows-based drivers will
NOT work for Kali.  Kali will NOT work in a DOS windows under
Windows 95.  A version of Kali written to work with Win95's built-
in TCPIP drivers is in development.  Please don't email and ask
when it will be finished.  I just don't know yet.

                   Getting Prepared - Software

In addition to the hardware requirements, some software is also
required to complete your setup. Before you can play, you'll need
to pick up the following:

* A packet driver.  The packet driver is a standardized interface
that lets Kali "talk" to an ethernet card or modem.  PPP users can
use Merit's etherppp (ppp.zip) or Klos's PPP driver (pppshare.zip). 
SLIP users can use slipper or cslipper (slippr15.zip).

* Kali, the TCP/IP network driver for IPX games.

* Some basic network diagnostic tools, such as a PING and TCPINFO
program. These are not absolutely necessary, but can definitely be
useful for debugging and testing your setup (apps.zip).

Finding Kali and Related Files
------------------------------
To obtain Kali, log on to one of the following ftp sites (using
anonymous ftp). Change to the specified directory (e.g. cd
/pub/kali). Download the file kali12k.zip.  This is the latest
version of Kali as of this writing.

ftp://ftp.kali.net/kali/
ftp://ftp.axxis.com/pub/kali/
ftp://ftp.internexus.net/pub/kali/

The following Web sites also include information and some files:

http://www.axxis.com/kali/
http://www.internexus.net/kali/
http://www.teleport.com/~caustic/
http://gremlinx.bevc.blacksburg.va.us/
http://www.kali.net/     (under construction)

Finding ethernet packet drivers (not needed for modem use)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Many ethernet cards come with the appropriate packet drivers on a
utilities diskette packaged with the card. If your card does not
come with a packet driver, there is an excellent collection of
freely available packet drivers called the Crynwr Packet Driver
collection. You can obtain it via anonymous ftp from:

ftp://oak.oakland.edu/simtel/msdos/pktdrvr/pktd11.zip
ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/simtel/msdos/pktdrvr/pktd11.zip

Most of the Kali ftp sites mentioned above also carry this
collection of drivers.


Finding slip or ppp packets drivers
-----------------------------------
SLIP (or SLiRP) users should get the file slippr15.zip and PPP
users should get the file ppp.zip.  Both of these files can be
found at the Kali sites listed above.

Diagnostic Software
-------------------
If you need basic network diagnostic utilities, the WATTCP
applications are freely available and include a PING program.  Look
for a file called apps.zip on your favorite ftp site, or find it
and other wattcp sources at:

ftp://dorm.rutgers.edu/pub/msdos/wattcp/

NOTE: people using SLiRP will not be able to use ping utility.

                     Setting up the Hardware

Setting up your computer to use a DOS packet driver can be
complicated for people who aren't network gurus.  This section will
attempt to show you all the steps needed to get the packet driver
installed and functioning properly.

Ethernet Setup Procedure (NOT for modem users!)
-----------------------------------------------
Step 0: START WITH A CLEAN BOOT!!!!!  Set up your CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files to load as few drivers as possible.  Some
definite things to EXclude are memory managers (HIMEM, EMM386,
QEMM, etc.) and network drivers (e.g. LSL, IPXODI).  Most games
don't need the former, and the latter will probably conflict with
the packet driver.  We recommend that you prepare an alternate
configuration (the multiple configuration facility built into
MS-DOS is ideal for this purpose; see your DOS manual for details)
specifically for Internet games with a CONFIG.SYS portion
containing only a FILES=20 line, and an AUTOEXEC.BAT portion
containing only the line "prompt=$p$g".  Be sure to include the
line which loads your mouse driver (if you play your game using a
mouse).

Step 1: Set up the packet driver.  If you do not already have a
suitable packet driver installed on your machine, now is the time
to install one.  Start by determining your ethernet card's IRQ
setting, it's base I/O port setting, and it's memory address
setting (if any).  You should be able to determine this by looking
at the card itself and consulting the user manual.  You'll need
some if not all of this information, depending upon which packet
driver you use and/or type of hardware you have (for example, some
IBM computers with theMicroChannel bus can determine the settings
on the card automatically without you having to supply them on the
packet driver command line).  Unzip the appropriate driver from
Crynwr Packet Driver collection archive.  In our example, the
packet driver is called SMC_WD.COM.  By looking at the jumpers on
the card and consulting the manual, I determined that the card has
been set to IRQ 7, Base I/O port address 300h, and the base memory
address is at segment d800h.  For this example, I have chosen to
use interrupt 60h for the packet driver.  Packet drivers typically
operate on an interrupt in the range of 60h to 80h inclusive; since
nothing else in my sample system happens to be using the first
available interrupt (INT 60h), I chose that.  Thus, to load my
packet driver, I use the command line

        SMC_WD 0x60 0x7 0x300 0xd800

where 0x60 is the packet driver interrupt, 0x7 is the IRQ setting
on the card, 0x300 is the I/O port base address, and 0xd800 is the
memory base address (NOTE: all numbers are in C-style HEX
notation).  Don't worry if you don't understand what all this stuff
means - as long as you use the correct numbers, your packet driver
should work.  NOTE: If your PC is currently part of a Novell
network (e.g. Netware, Netware Lite, Personal Netware) the
parameters you need can be found in a file called NET.CFG, usually
located in your \NOVELL, \NWLITE or \NWCLIENT subdirectories (along
with all the other drivers needed by Novell).  Add the proper
command line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT for your Kali configuration so
that the packet driver will be loaded automatically whenever you
boot using the Kali partition.

When successfully loaded, the packet driver should give a sign on
message and report the ethernet address of your NIC when you load
it.  Chances are that if your NIC has been functioning properly for
other tasks (e.g. as a node on a Novell network) then you'll have
no problems here.  If not, or if there are any error or warning
messages, something is wrong (D'OHH!).  One possibility is that one
of the settings on your NIC is in conflict with those of another
expansion card in your system. No two cards can have the same IRQ,
I/O port, or memory address settings, nor can the memory areas of
two cards overlap.  Whatever the cause, you'll need to find and
correct the problem before continuing.
SLIP Setup Procedure
--------------------

This procedure assumes that you are using the cslipper SLIP driver
mentioned earlier. If you are using a different driver, you'll need
to change the commands which follow accordingly.

Step 0: Obtain Internet access from a service provider who allows
SLIP connections on their terminal server. A "shell account" (where
you log in to a remote UNIX host and type commands such as "telnet"
and "ftp") will require a SLIP emulator called SLiRP (read the
SLiRP section below before continuing).  How to obtain this type of
service from such a provider is beyond the scope of this document. 
Also, if you are using a Microsoft Windows-based SLIP or PPP
driver, such as Trumpet Winsock, you MUST obtain and install a DOS
SLIP or PPP driver on your machine.  Kali will NOT work with
Windows drivers such as Trumpet or Cameleon.  It will NOT work with
Windows 95 drivers or even work with DOS drivers in a Windows 95
DOS session.  You will have to reboot in DOS mode.

Step 1: Using your favorite serial communications package, dial in
to your service provider, log in, and issue whatever commands are
required to change their terminal server to SLIP mode. How this is
done varies from service provider to service provider and is beyond
the scope of this document. Check with your service provider for
more details.  

Once you have logged on and enabled SLIP mode, exit your
telecommunications software WITHOUT HANGING UP THE MODEM - this is
VERY IMPORTANT!  Any telecommunications package worth the floppy on
which it comes will have a "save without hangup" command, or will
prompt you when you exit to ask whether it should hang up or not.

Change to the directory where you have installed your packet driver
and load it. An example command line for CSLIPPER is

CSLIPPER com1 vec=0x60 baud=57600

where com1 is the serial port to which your modem is connected,
0x60 is the interrupt vector the packet driver should use, and
57600 is the DTE baud rate (the baud rate between the computer and
the modem, not necessarily the speed at which the modem has
connected to the remote system).  The packet driver will display a
signon message and load itself into memory.

Your SLIP packet driver is now loaded and ready for testing.
Using Kali with a PPP account and Merit's etherppp
==================================================

First you need a login script.  The login script must be in the
file called dial.ppp.  Here is an example script:

DIAL.PPP:

send "at&f2\r"           ;select factory default settings
recv 3000 "OK\r\n"       ;wait 3 seconds for OK response from modem
send "atdt1234567\r"     ;dial your provider; the \r is for RETURN
recv 60000 "login:"      ;wait 60 seconds for login prompt
send "<username>\r"      ;send your username and RETURN
recv 10000 "Password:"   ;wait 1 second for password prompt
send "<password>\r"      ;send your password and RETURN

Note: the login and password prompts much match those used by your
provider.  If your host uses the prompt "Please login:" you can get
away  with telling ppp to look for just "login:".  Be very careful
that you use the EXACT same spelling, capitalization, and spacing
that your host's prompt uses.  If your host uses "login :" and you
put "login:" in dial.ppp (notice the missing space) the script will
never complete.  For the password prompt be sure to match the
host's password prompt (or at least the last word or last few
letters of the prompt).  For example, if your host's password
prompt is "Enter you Password:", you could put "Password:" in
dial.ppp.  Something shorter like "word:" would also work. If you
changed the capitalization to "password:" the script would not
work. 

If the script appears to stop after a certain prompt, there is
probably something wrong with your script.  Be patient if it seems
to stop after the password prompt since there is usually a delay of
about 5-30 seconds before the host reports your ip# and ppp returns
to the DOS prompt.

The setup string above, at&f2, works for most Hayes modems.  If you
have a USR modem try at&f1.  If in doubt check your modem's manual
for a setup string that turns on data compression, error
correction, and hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.

The next thing you need is a batch file to run ppp.exe.  Edit the
sample batch filed called dial.bat to match your system
requirements.

DIAL.BAT:

ppp /c 2 /d script /s 57600 /v

The "/c 2" tells PPP to dial out on COM2.  The "/d script" tells
PPP to use the file DIAL.PPP as a script. The "/s 57600" tells PPP
to connect at 57600 (I've got a 14.4 modem and 16550 UART).  As of
this writing, 57600 is the fastest speed supported by ppp.exe (some
people fool ppp.exe into running at 115200 by using /s 65500).  If
you don't have a 16550 uart, you should select 38400 for the speed. 
The /v tells ppp to use verbose mode (displays more on the screen).

Put your nickname in kali.cfg and then put your network information
in wattcp.cfg.  In many cases, this information will change each
time you connect.  In this case, you will have to re-edit
wattcp.cfg each time.

A program called snatch is included with Kali.  Running snatch
right after ppp.exe will usually fix the ip# in wattcp.cfg for you.
It will only work if ppp.exe, snatch.exe, and wattcp.cfg are all in
the same directory.  Read the snatch.doc file.

Kali with Compuserve and Merit's etherppp
=========================================

From: Lawrence Reiss <72620.1261@compuserve.com>

Here's the script:

send "at&f2\r"                     ;at&f1 for USR
recv 3000 "OK\r\n"
send "atdt9323198\r"               ;put your local access# here
recv 60000 "CONNECT"
send "\r"
recv 60000 "Host Name:"
send "CIS\r"
recv 60000 "User ID:"
send "12345,1234/go:pppconnect\r"  ;put your own login id here
recv 60000 "Password:"
send "<password>\r"                ;and your own password

Run the dialer in the usual way with this script, remembering NOT
to touch the keyboard until you get an ip address.  There will be
a delay of perhaps 30 seconds or so.

Copy the ip number onto the my_ip line of the wattcp.cfg file, or
use the program "snatch".  Run kali in the usual way!


Using Kali with Netcom's Netcruiser and Merit etherppp
-------------------------------------------------------

From: Byron Followell <followel@ix.netcom.com>

Use this script:

send "at&f2\r"           (or at&f1 for USR)
recv 3000 "OK\r\n"
send "atdt5551212\r"     (substitute your local number)
recv 60000 "login: "
send "#<username>\r"     (substitute your own username)
recv 6000 "Password: "
send "<password>\r"      (and your password goes here)

Make sure you keep the # in front of your username. That's what
logs you onto a PPP connection.  Replace <password> with your valid
password. 

Your IP address will change everytime, but, only the last number
should change. For example, you may be on 204.31.246.55 this
session and then 204.31.246.23 then next time.

Using Kali with Klos' pppshare Driver
=====================================

This driver is more complicated to setup than Merit's etherppp
driver.  It does offer a faster connection and uses less memory so
it's worth the extra effort in most cases.

Get the files pppshare.zip and lsl.zip from your favorite Kali ftp
site.  Don't get the ppp.exe from ppp.zip and pppshare.zip mixed
up.  They are completely different.  Unzip pppshare.zip and lsl.zip
in your Kali directory.

The first step is configuring net.cfg.  You can use pppmenu to edit
this file or manually edit the sample.cfg file that came with
pppshare (be sure to rename it net.cfg).  If you run pppmenu
without the lsl.com and ppp.exe loaded it will still allow you to
modify your net.cfg file, but it won't allow you to start a
connection.


Using pppmenu to configure net.cfg
----------------------------------
Since the menu system in pppmenu is fairly extensive I won't cover
everything, but I'll try to explain most of it.  Run pppmenu.  You
will get the Main Menu.  If ppp.exe is already loaded you will get
options for Connect, Disconnect, Status Display, Hang-up, and
Terminal Mode.  If ppp.exe isn't loaded you will only get an option
to edit the Current Configuration.  We want to edit this
configuration.  If ppp.exe is loaded select Connect and the press
F1 to Modify Profile.  If ppp.exe is not loaded just press enter on
the Current option.

Port menu:

     I/O Port: allows you to select com1/2/3/4 or special.  If you
               select "special" you will be given the chance to set
               your modem's Base Port.

     Interrupt: this is usually selected automatically based on the
               I/O port you selected above.  For com1 and com3 use
               interrupt 4.  For com2 and com4 use interrupt 3.

     Baudrate: if you are using a 16550 uart and a 28.8 modem
               select 115200.  Some people have reported problems
               running at this speed.  Try 57600 if you get
               lockups.  If you have a 16550 uart and a 14.4 modem
               select 57600.  If you don't have a 16550 uart you
               must select a speed of 38400 or slower.

     Flow Control: select Hardware.

     Open Type: select Active for most configurations.



     Listen: select Don't Answer.

     Connection type: you have a choice here.  If you know your
               script works and you don't want to watch it run,
               select Modem-Auto Dial.  If you want to watch the
               connection process from pppmenu select Modem-Demand
               Dial.  If you don't want to run a script and want to
               login manually, select Modem-Terminal.

     Frame Type: this option will not affect pppshare with Kali. 
               Pick anything you want (I use Ethernet II).

Modem Menu:

     Phone Number: put your local access number here.

     Modem Name: just a description of your modem.

     Command Strings: these are your modem's setup strings.  Use
               the Initialization Strings to setup your modem to
               use data compression, error correction, and RTS/CTS 
               flow control.  Most Hayes compatables need at&f2 and
               USR modems use at&f1.  Check you modem's manual. 
               The Dialing Prefix should be set to ATDT in most
               cases.  Answer string isn't used but should be set
               to ATA.  The hangup string for most modems is ATH0.

     Timers/Counters: Set the number of Dial Retries to 10.  Set
               the Connection Timeout to 90.  Pause time to 5.
               Inactivity time to 5.  These numbers aren't written
               in stone, but there's usually no reason to modify
               them.

Scripting Menu:

     This is where you setup your dialing script.  The scripting is
     accomplished by having you provide a set of prompts and the
     appropriate responses to each.  You do not have to enter the
     prompts for dialing and connecting since this will be taken
     care of automatically by pppshare.  Your script will probably
     begin with a prompt (Expected String) something like
     "username:".  The response would be your actual username.  If
     you put a "\r" at the end of the response, pppshare will type
     a carriage-return for you.  You *DO* want this in most cases.
     You will then probably need to enter a prompt for your
     password in a similar manner.  If you get confused, you can
     always manually edit the script by editting net.cfg as
     described in the next section of this FAQ.  Most standard C
     string sequences can be used.  E.g. \n for newline,  \0-7
     octal number, \" double quote, \r carriage return, etc.

LCP Parameters:

     Maximum Receive Unit: set to 1500.

     Async-Control Map: set to FFFFFFFF.

     Magic Number: set to 00000000.

     Protocol Compression: normal set on.  Some people might have
               to turn this off if using an older PPP terminal
               server.

     Address/Control Compression: same as above.  Normally on.

IP Parameters:

     Enable/Disable IP: Set to Enable IP.

     Header Compression: set to Disable for pppshare.  The
               shareware version will not support header
               compression.  Since this won't affect Kali don't
               worry about it.

     IP Address: doesn't matter.  You do NOT have to set this to
               the number you are using when you connect.

Authentication Menu:  

     Select the None option unless you want to use PAP.  The setup
     for PAP is beyond the scope of this FAQ.


That's it!  See?  Easy as cake!  OK, what did we do when we ran
pppmenu?  We created a file called net.cfg.  Read the next section
to find out more.  Actually, you have to read the next section
anyway since pppmenu doesn't cover the Link Support section of the
net.cfg file.

Manually Editing net.cfg for pppshare and Kali
----------------------------------------------
The net.cfg file needs two sections for using Kali with pppshare. 
The first section is called the Link Support section.  Notice that
capitalization doesn't matter in most cases (except for scripting).
The link support section should look something like this:

LINK SUPPORT
     BUFFERS 8 1500
     MEMPOOL 8192

This section is used by LSL.  LSL is "Link Support Layer."  It's a
standard developed by Novell to make it easier to develop drivers
for different types of connections (SLIP, PPP, ethernet).  

The Buffers line tells LSL to create 8 buffers each 1500 bytes in
size. The 1500 you see here shouldn't be changed.  You can adjust
the number of buffers but usually this should be between 4 and 16. 
The more buffers you have the less likely you are to lose an
incoming packet when traffic is going in quickly.  The only reason
you don't always want to run 16 buffers is because each buffer
takes up 1.5K.  16 of these would be 24K!  Most people can't afford
this much memory.  If you have some upper memory to spare you can
load lsl high and all of these buffers will be created in upper
memory (assuming there's room).  

Mempool is an area of memory used by LSL when doing it's work. 
There isn't much reason to adjust this too much, but be sure to
have at least 4096 bytes.  You might go as high as 16384, but I
really don't know if it will give you any performance increase.  If
it does, please let me know and I'll pass this information along.

The next section of the net.cfg file is the Link Driver section. 
In the case of pppshare this will be labeled "Link Driver PPP".  If
you rename ppp.exe to another name like sillyppp.exe, you will have
to rename this section "Link Driver sillyppp".

Here is a typical link driver section:

LINK DRIVER PPP
     CONFIGURATION "Current"
     FRAME ETHERNET_II
     PORT COM2
     BAUD 115200
     FLOW CONTROL HARDWARE
     CONNECTION AUTODIAL
     OPEN ACTIVE
     DIAL 5551212
     MODEM NAME "Supra FAXmodem"
     MODEM INIT3 "at&f2"
     IPXCP DISABLE
     PCOMP ON
     ACCOMP ON
     SCRIPT1 "login:" "#joecool\r" 20
     SCRIPT2 "Password:" "snoopy\r" 30

This isn't all the information that is possible in the link driver
section, but it contains all the important parts for Kali usage.
The CONFIGURATION keyword is just a way to identify this particular
setup.  FRAME isn't used with Kali so you can ignore it for now. 
PORT and BAUD should be obvious.  FLOW CONTROL should always be set
to HARDWARE.  

CONNECTION can be set to direct, modem, autodial, demand, or
terminal.  This tells ppp.exe what to do when it loads.  The direct
and modem options aren't normally used.  Set to autodial if you
know the script works.  Set to demand if you want to manually start
the script from within pppmenu.  Set to terminal if you want to do
the entire login process from a terminal window in pppmenu.

Leave OPEN set to active for most setups.  Try passive if the host 
hangs up on you when you first connect to it.

Use DIAL to set the phone number of your internet provider.  The
Modem Name option is just a way to tell someone reading this script
what kinda modem you have.

MODEM INIT|INIT1, MODEM INIT2, and MODEM INIT3 are used to set init
strings for your modem.  Most Hayes compatables only need at&f2 and
most USR modems need at&f1.  Check your modem's manual to find the
init string needed to get data compression, error correction and
RTS/CTS flow control.

IPXCP DISABLE must be set when using the shareware driver
(pppshare).  Don't worry, this doesn't affect the IPX in Kali.
PCOMP and ACCOMP are PPP compression strategies.  These are
normally set to ON.  

The SCRIPT lines are used to accomplish simple scripting.  These
lines consist of three parts: the expected prompt, the appropriate
response, and the time to wait in seconds.  In the example above
ppp would wait 20 seconds for the "Host Name:" prompt.  If it gets
the prompt it will reply with "CIS\r".  The "\r" tells ppp to issue
a carriage return.  If ppp doesn't see the "Host Name:" prompt for
20 seconds it will go ahead and issue the "CIS\r" response and
continue to the next script line.

Loading the Drivers
-------------------
Unlike Merit's etherppp (ppp.zip), the Klos driver has several
pieces.  You must load these in the proper order to get the driver
running.  You can create a batch file to simplify matter.  My match
file looks like this:

     dial.bat:

     lsl
     ppp
     pppmenu
     pppwat
     ipstub

Only the lsl, ppp, and ipstub programs actually remain in memory. 
The pppmenu program is used to monitor your connection and the
pppwat program edits your wattcp.cfg file for you to put the proper
ip# in the my_ip line.  All of these files including kali.exe and
wattcp.cfg should reside in the same directory.

If you run the batch file above, lsl will load, ppp will load
(after a brief pause), and the pppmenu will run.  What you do in
pppmenu depends on how you setup net.cfg.  If you set net.cfg to
autodial, you can just select the Status Displays.  You will see a
screen with a bunch of silly numbers that mean nothing to most of
us.  The important thing to watch is the LCP State and IPCP State
displays.  These will say "Initial" when you first see them.  They
should eventually say "?????" <look it up> when your connection
completes properly.  At this time you can exit pppmenu and the
pppwat program will run quicky as it edits wattcp.cfg and then the
IPSTUB program will load.

If you set net.cfg for demand dial you will need to select the
Connect option in pppmenu to start the connection.  You should see
the status of the connection as it attempts to complete.  If you
selected "terminal" you will have to enter the Terminal Mode screen
and manually dial and connect to your provider.  You're on your own
here folks.

What is IPSTUB?  IPSTUB is your packet driver.  It provides the
interface between Kali and pppshare.  It's very similar to ODIPKT
except that it doesn't require any configuration information in
net.cfg or any command-line options to load properly.

Any of these drivers, lsl, ppp, and ipstub, can be loaded into
upper memory.  You can load just one or two into upper memory or
all three or none.  Doesn't matter.  At least you have three small
files and at least one or two will usually fit in an upper memory
block.

Using Kali with pppshare
------------------------
Once the drivers are loaded Kali should work just like when used
with any other driver.  Most people find pppshare to be faster than
etherppp and it always uses less memory to load.

Don't forget to set netmask = 0.0.0.0 and ppp = 1 in wattcp.cfg
just like you would do with etherppp.

Using Kali With a Shell Account
===============================

To use Kali with a shell account, you need a SLIP emulator.  The
only SLIP emulator that current supports port-redirection
(something very important to Kali) is a program called SLiRP.  Many
internet providers, including netcom, use TIA for SLIP access.  TIA
2.0 doesn't work with Kali.  Use SLiRP instead. 

You *must* use SLiRP version 0.9k or newer.  The older versions
just won't work with Kali (problems with the UDP redirection code). 
To get SLiRP, login into your shell account and from there download
the SLiRP source code from your favorite Kali site, or the latest
can always be found at:

ftp://blitzen.canberra.edu.au/pub/slirp/

The instructions for installing SLiRP are included with this
program.  The installation of SLiRP is done from your shell
account, not DOS.  Basically, you will need to unzip the archive
first by typing:

gunzip slirp-0.9k.tar.gz

You then must untar the archive by typing:

tar -xvf slirp-0.9k.tar

This will create a directory structure called slirp-0.9k/.  Go to
the src subdirectory by typing cd slirp-0.9k/src.  Type:

configure

Then type: 

make

This will create a file called slirp.  Copy this file to your home
directory.  Something like:

cp slirp ~

might work.  Then, using your favorite text editor, create a file
called .slirprc in your home directory.  Put the following in this
file:

redir udp 2213 to aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:2213
baudrate 28800
mtu 2000

*** VERY IMPORTANT - SLiRP USERS PLEASE READ THIS ***

Replace aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd with the ip number of the host (unix)
machine.  Use this same number in your wattcp.cfg file.  Your ip
number will be the same as that of your host.  Do NOT use the ip
number reported by SLiRP anywhere in your configuration.  If you
do, it just won't work!  I'm serious.  I *know* that SLiRP says you
can use any ip number you want.  For most applications this is
fine, but Kali *must* *must* *must* have SLiRP setup using the unix
host's ip# in wattcp.cfg (my_ip) and in the redirection commands in
.slirprc.  Ok?

Also, the baudrate is not the actual speed of the modem.  It's hard
to explain.  Read the SLiRP docs for more info.  Basically, higher
numbers have faster through-put and slower response; lower numbers
have slower through-put and faster response.  You can experiment.

Next, follow all the steps for using SLIP above.  As far as
connecting to your SLIP provider, connect to your shell account as
you normally would.  If you are connecting through a terminal
server, be sure to get an 8 bit connection using rlogin.  Some
terminal servers have commands like "terminal download" or "set
session 1 passall" to provide a better connection for pseudo SLIP
users.  If you have trouble with Kali working through a terminal
server, be sure to look into this.  After attaching and logging in,
just type slirp.  Exit your communication program without hanging
up and continue like other SLIP users (see above).

NOTE: Since SLiRP users must share the ip number of their host, two
Kali players on the same host will have to use different ports for
Kali.  If you get an error when running SLiRP that says you don't
have permission to redirect the port, try using a different port. 
Try 2214 instead.  IMPORTANT: if you use a different port, be sure
to add a line in your kali.cfg file that reads something like:

port = 2214

Also, if you plan to host a Kali VSN, the other players will have
to enter your port number on the command line like this:

Kali aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd 2214
                    Setting up and using Kali

Step 1: Set up a new directory where Kali and all its configuration
files will be kept. You can name this directory anything you like
(I suggest c:\Kali). UnZIP the kali103.zip file into this new
directory, and make it the default (chdir to it). We will refer to
this directory as the "Kali directory."

Step 3: Set up your WATTCP.CFG file. Your WATTCP.CFG file contains
important parameters used by the WATTCP TCP/IP kernel built into
Kali. These values MUST be entered correctly if you wish to make a
connection with another Kali node.  In preparation for this, you'll
need several bits of information.  Ethernet users should contact
the network administrator for your site and find out the IP address
for your machine, the IP address for your gateway or router, the IP
address of at least one Domain Name Server local to your site, and
your netmask value.  SLIP and PPP users will only have to know
their own ip# and a nameserver; the ip# is usually reported each
time you connect.  If using snatch this will be taken care if
automatically when you connect.  IP addresses consist of four
groups of digits separated by periods.  In our example, the
machine's IP address is 128.191.23.5, the gateway is 128.191.23.1,
the netmask is 255.255.255.0, and the nameserver address is
128.191.44.67.  NOTE: it is important to use the numeric IP
addresses, not the actual host names. NOTE: If you have other
internet programs currently installed on your machine, such as a
Gopher client, the Trumpet newsreader, or the iFrag program, you
can probably find the information you need in the configuration
files used for those programs.  If the application is based on the
Waterloo TCP package, it will have it's own WATTCP.CFG, in which
case you can simply copy it over to your Kali directory. When you
have collected all this information, use your favorite ASCII text
editor to edit the WATTCP.CFG file in your Kali directory. Edit or
add the lines beginning with my_ip=, gateway=, nameserver=, and
netmask=. On our example machine, the WATTCP.CFG file for an
ethernet user looks like this:

my_ip = 128.191.23.5
gateway = 128.191.23.1
netmask = 255.255.255.0
nameserver = 128.191.23.9

For a PPP user:

my_ip = 128.191.23.5
nameserver = 128.191.23.9
netmask = 0.0.0.0
ppp = 1

For a SLIP user:

my_ip = 128.191.23.5
nameserver = 128.191.23.9


If you are a PPP user don't forget the ppp=1 option.  The sample
wattcp.cfg that comes with Kali already has this line but it has a
semicolon and a space in front of it.  Remove the semicolon and
space to activate the option.

Save the changed file and exit back to DOS.

If you don't know the proper values for some or all of these
settings, you can see if your site runs what is called a BOOTP
server. If your LAN has a BOOTP server installed, you can put
"BOOTP" on the "my_ip=" line and leave the other lines out (except
the ppp=1 line).  Kali will contact the BOOTP server and determine
all the settings it needs to communicate with other machines on the
Internet. If your site is not running a BOOTP server, then your
task is a little more difficult (but not impossible!)

Ethernet players only: If you know your machine's IP address, but
you can't determine the other values, you can often get away with
some educated guesswork. For instance, the gateway for a subnet
usually has an IP address ending in .1, as is the case with our
example. Thus, if your IP address is xxx.yyy.zzz.www, try setting
your gateway's IP address to xxx.yyy.zzz.1. As for the subnet mask,
a common value for this parameter is 255.255.255.0. In some cases,
the gateway value can be something like xxx.yyy.1.1 with a
corresponding netmask value of 255.255.0.0 - if one doesn't work,
it can't hurt to try the other. Finally, if you don't know your
nameserver's IP address, you can probably get by without it for the
purposes of playing Internet games. Since you'll be specifying IP
addresses for all of your opponents' machines, a nameserver lookup
won't be necessary to resolve their addresses.


                    Testing your TCP/IP Setup

If everything looks OK, the next step is to use the PING program to
test your connection (SLiRP users will have to skip this section).
At the DOS prompt, type

PING <ip#> 10

<ip#> should be replaced with a know ip#.  The list of servers
below would be a good set to test with.  An example might be:

PING 204.96.20.10 10

After a brief delay, you should see 10 lines showing a response
from the host including the round trip time for PING's test
packets.  If you see the "Timeout" error message, then something is
wrong with your setup; if your PC is unable to ping, kali will
probably not work.


              Put Me in, Coach - I'm Ready to Play!

Not quite yet.  Be sure to edit your kali.cfg and kchat.cfg files. 
Registered users should be sure to include a serial#, key, skey,
realname, email, and other parameters.  Something like this:

kali.cfg
--------
Nickname = KingThug  (that's me!)
serial = xxxxxxxxxxxx
key = xxxxxxxxxxxx
skey = xxxxxxxxxxxx
realname = Jay Cotton
email = jay@kali.net
other = Call 1-801-565-1443 and order Kali today!
tracker = 206.197.190.20
@world = kali.net
@central = 204.96.20.10
@bob = 128.191.23.34

The lines beginning with the @ sign are server shortcuts.  These
lines allow you to type:

KALI @world

and Kali will look in the kali.cfg file for "@world=" and replace
this with the actual ip# or address.  You can also type "kali /a"
and Kali will query all the servers on the Kali Tracker and list
the players.

kchat.cfg
---------
Nickname = KingThug
lines = 50
beeponarrival
macro1 = I *really* hate macros!
macro2 = This is my second macro!
macro3 = This is my third macro!
macro8 = This is my eighth macro!
macro9 = /quit Bah! Humbug!

The macros are accessible by pressing alt-#, where # is replaced by
the number of the macro.  "lines" can be set to 25 or 50. 
"beeponarrival" causes Kali Chat to beep when people join.  Read
the sample kchat.cfg for more.


                  Now I'm Really Ready!  Right?

All right!  Kali is now installed and ready for carnage!  Now you
need to find opponents.  There are several Kali Servers that you
can connect to and find other players.

Kali Servers are special Kali nodes that run 24 hours a day, all
year round.  The purpose of Kali Servers is to provide a common
meeting place for Kali players.  Here is the most recent list of
Kali Servers:

ip#            Name           Full name
---            ----           ---------
204.96.20.10   Kali Central   tracker.texas.net
206.197.190.20 Kali World     kali.net
205.199.96.2   AXXIS Server   axxis.com
204.97.214.4   CastleNet      kali.castle.net
193.130.144.1  FlexNet        gate.dungeon.com
204.213.70.6   Internexus     kali.internexus.net

To connect to a Kali Server, just type:

Kali <server ip#>

Once connected you will see a list of other people wanting to play
games.  Next to each name you will see what program they are
running.  If you see anyone running DESCENTR, then you know that a
game of registered Descent is probably already underway and you can
go ahead and load Descent and join the game.  If you see people
running KCHAT, then you know they are wanting to chat.  See the
Kali Chat section below.

Once we decide to play a game, we exit Kali Chat and switch to our
game directory (in this case c:\games\descent) and load our games
in the usual way. 


                     Using Kali Chat (Kchat)

Kali Chat is an IRC-like chat program for IPX networks.  It was
written to help people using Kali communicate  before and after
playing games.  It will work over a local IPX network or over a
Kali Virtual SubNet.

To run Kali Chat, edit kchat.cfg 

KCHAT.CFG:

nickname = Newbie
shownodes
nobeep
beeponarrival
lines = 50
macro1 = This is my first macro!
macro2 = This is my second macro!
macro9 = This is my ninth macro!
macro0 = This is my zeroth macro!

Put your own nickname for "nickname."  The "shownodes" option
displays ip numbers next to everyone's nickname while chatting.  It
can be annoying so just remove this line if you don't want it.  The
"nobeep" option stops the beeping that normally occurs when you get
a private message.  The "beeponarrival" option will cause the PC to
beep when new people arrive in Kchat.  The "lines" parameter can be
set to either 25 or 50.  If you leave it out Kchat will use the
default screen size when you run kchat (as long as it's either 25
or 50 lines).

To run Kchat just type:

kchat 

If you use Kchat without a kchat.cfg file it will require you to
enter your nickname on the command line, "kchat mynickname".  If
you use Kchat with Kali the Kali nickname will override the Kchat
nickname set in kchat.cfg.

You will automatically start out on the #chat channel.  To see who
else is on this channel, type /who.  To see everyone using Kali
Chat, type /who *.  To see a list if users on a specific channel,
type /who #channelname.

To join a channel, type /join #channelname.  To exit, type /quit.

To use Kali Chat with Kali.  First run Kali and connect to a
server; then run Kchat.  After finding players for a game, exit
Kali Chat and directly launch your game.  No need to re-run Kali.

These are the commands that you can enter while in Kali Chat:

/help - display the list of commands
/clear - clear screen
/[25|50] - select 25 or 50 line mode
/nick <nickname> - change nickname
/away <message> - tell everyone that you are away from your PC
/beep [on|off] - beep when getting a private message
/join <#channel> - join a different channel
/who [<#channel>|*] - list people using Kali Chat
/whois <nickname> - get information on a registered user
/msg [<nickname>|#<node>] <message> - send a private message
/me <message> - posture a message
/ping [<nickname>|#<node>|*] - test connection speed
/ignore <nickname> - toggles the ability to ignore someone
/shownodes - will display the user's ip# next to each nickname
/hidenodes - will not display the ip numbers
/offer <filename> - offer a file for other people to download
/get <nickname> <#> <localname> - get file <#> as <localname>
/progress - displays download progress (from sender)
/kali - list people connected to the Kali server
/motd - display message of the day from server
/quit [<message>] - exit chat program

Pressing alt-x will also exit Kali Chat.  Pressing ctrl-l will
clear the screen.

When offering a file you can offer up to 10 files at a time and
several people can download these files at the same time. When you
"get" a file, you can name the file anything you want and put in in
any directory you want.  For example, if Wyvern offers the file "#0
c:\kali\kchat.exe" for downloading, you can type "/get Wyvern 0
d:\games\kali\kchat20.exe".  This will take file number "0" offered
by Wyvern and place it in the directory d:\games\kali\ and name the
file kchat20.exe.

                Using Kali Without a Kali Server

Kali will work without a server by having one of the PCs act as a
server.  In this mode Kali will only allow 4 player games (the
server plus three clients).  The server has a special role in this
mode and the faster PC should take the honors.  This PC will simply
type:

KALI

and press enter.  The other PCs will use the IP# of the host just
like they would when connecting to a normal server.  The kali /s
listing will not include the ping, process, loss, or time columns
like it does when using a normal server.  Everything else should
work normally.


                         A Final Thought

Killing your friends across the Internet can be VERY addictive.
Have fun, but don't lose your "real" life just to play a game!

(*) Hey, since I'm making up this hypothetical example scenario, I
might as well go whole hog, right? ;-)

                         Purchasing Kali

So, are you tired of the 15 minute limit in the demo?  Go ahead and
register!  The price of Kali is $20 (US dollars).  When you buy
Kali you will get your own personal serial number and key to unlock
the full power of Kali.  Play until you drop.

Once you buy Kali you will be assured free upgrades when Kali is
improved...even if the price goes up in the future.

                         Troubleshooting

Hopefully this might help some people who are having trouble
getting Kali to work.  Just read the questions.  

Q: Why does Kali report, "ERROR: Cannot access packet driver"?

A: You either don't have a packet driver loaded or you have another
driver loaded on top of your packet driver which won't allow Kali
to access it.  

Most packet drivers only allow one program to be loaded over them. 
Some packet drivers will automatically multiplex and allow you to
run 2 or more TCPIP applications on top of them.

Find the proper packet driver for your setup.  Instructions for
obtaining and installing the packet driver can be found in
kali.doc.


Q: Why does Kali report, "Error: no response from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"?

A: Either because the ip# you are trying to attach to is not
running Kali or you don't have Kali configured properly.  Try all
of the servers in the list above.

Have you tested your connection yet?  Can you ping any or all of
the servers?  Have you tried these steps?  If not, re-read the
section titled "Testing your TCPIP Setup".


Q: Why can't I ping anything?

A: Good question!  This means you are actually trying to test your
connection before using Kali!  I'm so happy!

Anyway, this is almost always caused by an incorrect value in
wattcp.cfg.  Either your netmask, gateway, or my_ip value is most
likely wrong.

If using a modem, are you sure you connected to your host properly? 
Did the host report that SLIP or PPP was started?  If using PPP,
did the PPP driver report your ip# (many SLIP hosts will do this
too)?   Are you absolutely positive that your modem is configured
for hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) and not software (XON/XOFF)? 
For Hayes modems, this is normally done with  AT&F2.  For USR
modems, try using AT&F1.

PPP users: try using a netmask of 0.0.0.0 and put the line ppp=1 in
wattcp.cfg.  Using a netmask of 0.0.0.0 will make the wattcp kernel
think that all nodes are in your local network.  It will cause Kali
and other wattcp apps to quit trying to use the gateway.  Using
ppp=1 with Kali will cause wattcp to quit trying to resolve
ethernet addresses (which it can't do anyway...but tries).

PPP and SLIP users: if using bootp, try entering your actual ip#
instead.

If using ethernet, are you sure you loaded the driver with the
correct I/O port, interrupt, and address (if used)?


Q: I can ping a server, but I can't connect with Kali.  Why?

A: Wow...getting close.  The most common problem causing this is an
incorrect modem init string.  Make sure that hardware flow control
and NOT software flow control is enable on the modem (see  A4
above).  This can also be caused by having the wrong info in
wattcp.cfg.  The server might be off-line.  Try another server.


Q: Ok, I finally connected to a server.  Now my PC locks up after
a few seconds.  I haven't even started a game yet.  Sometimes it
locks up before I even run Kali.  Sometimes I get the player list. 
What did I do wrong?

A: The most common cause is not having hardware (RTS/CTS) flow
control enabled (and software/XON/XOFF disabled).  Check the manual
for your modem  and make sure your init string enables RTS/CTS and
disables XON/XOFF. 

The second most common reason for PPP users is the omission of the
ppp=1 line in wattcp.cfg.  Also try using a netmask of 0.0.0.0 (PPP
only).

If using ppp, your provider might be using Link Quality Monitoring. 
If you cannot disable this option, you will not be able to use
Merit's etherppp driver.  Get a copy of pppshare.zip from one of
the sites listed above for  Kali and try this driver instead (get
lsl.zip while you are there).


Q: I can connect to a server, and I can even start playing a game. 
Now my PC locks up after a few seconds of playing.  What now?

A: Check the answer to Q7 above and if using ppp, be sure you have
the line "ppp=1" in wattcp.cfg.

Q: Why do I see myself listed twice in the kali /s list?

A: This is almost always a SLiRP problem.  If the ip number for
both entries is the same, and the port number is different, then
the redirection command in .slirprc failed (or you used the wrong
command).  If the ip number for both entries is different, then you
are using the wrong ip number in wattcp.cfg and probably the wrong
ip# in the redirection commands.  The second number you see is the
correct ip#.  Use this number in .slirprc and in wattcp.cfg.


Q: Why do I see myself listed more than 2 times in the kali /s
list?

A: You are using a SLIP emulator that is not compatable with Kali. 
The only SLIP emulator that works with Kali is SLiRP.  TIA will NOT
work.


Q: How can I get more conventional memory?

A: Use a memory manager such as DOS's emm386 or QEMM.  Load DOS
high and load Kali high (lh Kali).  You should be able to get Kali
into an upper memory block on most systems.  Read your DOS manual
or type "help emm386" at the DOS prompt.  If use have a CDROM, try
to avoid loading all of its drivers.  Using DOS 6.0 and above you
can create multiple configurations in your config.sys.  Again, read
the DOCS.

Most games that use their own memory menager (like Doom and
Descent) will still work when used with emm386 or qemm.  They also
still need at least some minimal conventional memory.  Both Doom
and Descent will have fits if the conventional memory is below 350K
(approx).

If using Merit's etherppp (ppp.zip) you might concider trying
pppshare instead.  It uses 20-30K less memory.

Q: This stupid document didn't help.  What do I do now?

A: If this list doesn't answer your question, please send your
question to:

help@kali.net

***NOTE***  You must include the following information for me to be
able to help.  Without this information, I won't answer most
questions.

                          Kali Thanks!

I would like to thank all of the people who have made contributions
to Kali.  Without these people you probably wouldn't be playing
internet games at all.

A special thanks goes to my wife Eleanor and daughter Jennifer.  I
thank my wife for her patience, for allowing me those long hours in
my office pecking away at the computer, for being my attorney, for
being a friend and listening to all my problems, and for supporting
me 100%.  I thank my daughter Jennifer for being herself.  She's
just great! :)

The following people and/or companies have contributed in one way
or another.  They are listed in chronological order of
contribution.  I may have made a mistake in the ordering of one or
two but hopefully I didn't leave anyone out.  If I did, *please*
let me know and I will correct it.

id Software - for writing Doom and providing the source code for
     ipxsetup.  This is what got me into multiplayer gaming!
Jake Page (snake) - the author of tcpsetup.  tcpsetup was the first
     program to allow internet Doom.
Erick Engelke  - the author of Waterloo TCP (wattcp).  Wattcp is
     used in both iFrag and Kali.
Scott Coleman (Khan) - the author of iFrag and the original IPX
     code in Kali.  My mentor, friend, and adversary (Doom) for a
     long time.
Parallax - for writing Descent...the program that inspired Kali. 
     I guess Interplay gets some credit here too. :)
Frank Fejes (Warp2) & PooterMan (I still don't know his name!) -
     for registering the first two copies of Kali!
Danny Gasparovski - the author of SLiRP.  He made several changes 
     to his program at my request.  Without his efforts shell users
     would be stuck with MILK ;-)
Patrick Klos - one of the authors of pppshare (along with his
     brother).  At my request they developed pppshare just for Kali
     users.
Jonathon Roy (roy7) - for porting the kali code to unix to make the
     first Kali server.  For providing consulting on further unix
     programming.
Edward Henigin (Texas Net) - for running the first Kali server and
     the iFrag Tracker.
Pramod Gumpeni (ZenMaster) - the author of the Kali Game FAQ and a
     beta tester.  My number one fan!  Also ran Zen's Temple.
Chung Lau (waver) - author of the netcom shell kit.  Available at
     most Kali ftp sites.
Ethan Winkley - author of the PPP FAQ.
Byron Followell - author of the Netcruiser FAQ.
Derek Bumpas - author of snatch.
Lawrence Reiss - author of the Compuserve FAQ.
loopy - for cracking every version of Kali before anyone else and
     letting me know just how bad my security was ;-)
Axxis Corporation - Mark Leslie, Mike Fine, Mike Maxwell, Suzie
     Peterson, Marsha Maxwell - for handling credit card orders,
     running a server, and official Web site.
Westwood Studios - for writing Command & Conquer and supplying me
     with a whole new set of customers :)

And all the other people who have ftp sites, web sites, kali
servers, etc.  Thanks for everyone who has helped test dozens of
version of Kali.  Thanks for everyone who has registered and
allowed me to continue to improve Kali.

There are so many people who have contributed ideas that it would
takes pages to list them all.  Thanks!


Despite all their efforts....  ;-)
