                         * THE JETPACK *
                         ***************


The jetpack model L1069-E is specially designed for human flight
with great power, but unfortunately it consumes a large quantity of
fuel.  You must find fuel for your jetpack before you can fly
around the dungeons.  Press down while flying to maintain constant
altitude.  Some levels contain no fuel, so you must rely on ladders
and be careful not to encounter any monsters on the ground.

There is also a Phase Shifter built in to your jetpack which
tunnels through bricks.  Some bricks are denser than others and
require more time to break through.  Grey stone is solid and cannot
be phased.  There are also other items that can be affected by the
Phase Shifter.  You'll have to experiment to discover what they
are.

                          * FEATURES *
                          ************

There are teleporters that transport you around the level, and
barriers that block your progress.  These barriers are deactivated
by pressing buttons of the same color.  Activate buttons and
teleporters by pressing down while touching them.  Monsters can
turn the barriers on and off by moving over colored floor switches. 
There are moving platforms and ladders that can help or hinder you. 
Icy bricks make it hard to walk, and some bricks are covered with
sludge, slowing your progress.  Monster Stunners, Shields, and fuel
appear randomly for a quick player to retrieve.  The Stunners make
the monsters harmless and paralyze them momentarily.  Shields
protect you from monsters, spikes, and all other hazards.

The level editor is one of the most exciting features in Jetpack. 
With it you can create thousands of your own levels to play and
share with friends.  Press [ENTER] for a layout of all 120 tiles
available for level construction.  Use the arrow keys to choose a
tile and then place it in the desired location with [SPACE].  The
joystick can also be used.  A quick way to pick a tile is to move
the cursor on to one that is already on the level screen and press
[INSERT] to pick it up.  A shortcut key for putting down background
tiles (erasing) is [DELETE].  This key is also used to erase
monsters and other objects.

If you're having trouble getting started on a level, press [R] to
randomly scatter your selected tile.  This will give you a
foundation around which to create a level.  The Block function also
helps in level construction.  Block works like the Block option in
most word processors.  Press [B] to mark the starting point of the
block, then move and press [B] again to mark the endpoint.  The
rectagonal area you have just selected is now saved in memory.  You
can press [P] to paste it down with the top-left at your current
cursor location.  Press [F] to fill the entire blocked area with
your selected tile.  Press [C] to clear the entire level.

There are eight types of monsters that you can use to make your
levels more challenging.  You can place up to 20 monsters in each
level, by pressing [1] to [8] for the monster type.  The monsters
are listed at the bottom of this page.

Before testing your level, you must set the starting location with
[S] and the location of the door with [D].  Test your level by
pressing [F2].

For the File Options menu, press [TAB].  From here you can choose
to [S]ave your level, [L]oad a level, [D]elete a level from disk,
or view a level with [ENTER].  Press [ESCAPE] to return to the
editor.

If you need help recalling these commands, press [F1] for help.

                     * MORE JETPACK STUFF! *
                     ***********************


     If you are a hardcore Jetpack fan, or just need some help with
any (or all!) of the 100 Jetpack levels, there used to be a
Jetpack Hint Book!  It came printed with an index of levels,
pictures of all 100 levels with a trace of the best route,
and a humorous level solution for each level.  Don't you wish you
had one?  It will probably be a collectors item some day.  Well
it's too late now.
It also reveals the ULTRA-SECRET cheat keys for Unlimited Lives,
and 2000 Shield Invincibility!  These keys were used by the
programmer for debugging and they remain hidden in the program!

     By the way, don't forget that secret cheat key that helps you
through tricky levels.  In any level, hold down the [BACKSPACE]
key, and ['] (apostrophe).  This will skip to the next level.  Use
it wisely, because this magic combination can only be used twice in
a game for each player!

OK, since you can't get the book I'll tell you the real cheat keys:
TAB + 2 + S  : Skip a Level
TAB + 2 + D  : Record a Demo (before starting)
TAB + 2 + L  : Extra Life
TAB + 2 + F  : Extra Fuel
TAB + 2 + I  : Invincible

If you like this, look for God of Thunder, it rocks!  But remember there's
this villager you have to talk to TWICE, everybody gets stuck on that.

that lets you switch graphics sets.  Run it to set Jetpack for
Christmas graphics, or Jetpack Junior graphics.
