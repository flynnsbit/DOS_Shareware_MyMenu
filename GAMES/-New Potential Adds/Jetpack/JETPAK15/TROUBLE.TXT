                            *******************
PROBLEM:
     Not Enough Memory
SOLUTION:
     Try removing TSR's (such as mouse drivers) from your config.sys and
     autoexec.bat files.
     If you have DOS version 5 or above, include the line:

          dos=high

     in your config.sys file after "himem.sys" or another memory manager has
     been loaded.
     As a last resort, try disabling Sound Blaster support so the digitized
     samples will not be loaded (see command-line sound overrides).

PROBLEM:
     Movement is erratic, or there is no movement
SOLUTION:
     Press [J] to adjust your joystick(s).
     Most systems should work with joysticks set to 'AUTO' in the main menu. 
     If movement is still erratic, try either setting joysticks to 'FORCE 1'
     which will scan only port 1, or disabling joysticks.

PROBLEM:
     Sound isn't working correctly, or the game locks up
SOLUTION:
     Use the command-line sound card override.
     Load Jetpack with one of the command-line options:

          Jetpack /S0    -    No Sound
          Jetpack /S1    -    PC Speaker
          Jetpack /S2    -    Adlib (or compatible)
          Jetpack /S3    -    Sound Blaster (or compatible)

SOUND BLASTER HELP
------------------
If your Sound Blaster or compatible card is not working in Jetpack, try
setting the environmental variable BLASTER by typing:

     SET BLASTER=Axxx Ix Dx

     Axxx represents the address of the SoundBlaster/SB Pro.  For the SB,
it's either A210,A220,A230,A240,A250 or A260.  For the SB Pro, it's either
A220 or A240.  The default is A220.
     Ix represents the IRQ number used by the SB/SB Pro.  For the SB, it's
either I2, I5, or I7.  The default is I7.
     Dx represents the DMA channel used by the SB/SB Pro.  Acceptable values
are D0, D1, or D3.  The default is D1.

If the game continually locks up and you have a Sound Blaster, as a last
resort try disabling the digitized Sound Blaster samples by using the Adlib
command-line override (Jetpack /S2).

Jetpack should have come without the configuration file "JETPACK.CFG"  If you
can't solve the problems you are having, try erasing this file.  Jetpack will
create a new config file based on your system.
