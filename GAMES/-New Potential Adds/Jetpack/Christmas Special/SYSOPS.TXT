      SYSOPS - Read VENDOR.TXT for complete descriptions for your BBS.

    If you are interested in getting quality Shareware for your BBS system,
then become part of the Shareware Distribution Network at Software Creations.
Thousands of Sysops have joined Software Creations and more are joining every
day in setting up file sections on their BBS systems for our Shareware.  We
make all these files FREE downloads, with unlimited time to download on the
Software Creations BBS.

    Once you have a Software Creations file section set up on your BBS, and
have our Shareware in it, just call the HOME BOARD and fill out the script in
door 4 with all the information about your BBS.  Just type OPEN 4 at the main
menu.  If you are already a Shareware release point for one of our other HOME
BOARD companies then just leave me a message to get you added to our list.

    We will carry your name and numbers in our bulletin, letting people know
where they can get our products in your area.  We also hope that getting high
quality software directly from the source brings more callers to your BBS, and
more paying members.

    If downloading is too much of a problem, whole shareware file sections can
be ordered on Software Creations for only the cost of duplication and mailing.

    I wish you luck with your BBS, and hope our shareware brings you lots of 
quality BBS members.
