                       CHRISTMAS SPECIAL!

                     (C) 1993  Adam Pedersen
                 Published by Software Creations


You are the daring adventurer Santa, in search of Christmas gifts! 
With your trusty jetpack strapped to your back, enter and explore
levels full of treasures and peril.  Your quest is to take all of
the gifts in each level without getting killed.  When you collect
all the gifts from a level, the portal to the next level will open. 
Collect treasure on the way to earn extra lives.

                         ***************
                         * THE JETPACK *
                         ***************


The jetpack model L1069-E is specially designed for human flight
with great power, but unfortunately it consumes a large quantity of
fuel.  You must find fuel for your jetpack before you can fly
around the dungeons.  Press down while flying to maintain constant
altitude.  Some levels contain no fuel, so you must rely on ladders
and be careful not to encounter any monsters on the ground.

There is also a Phase Shifter built in to your jetpack which
tunnels through bricks.  Some bricks are denser than others and
require more time to break through.  Grey stone is solid and cannot
be phased.  There are also other items that can be affected by the
Phase Shifter.  You'll have to experiment to discover what they
are.

                          ************
                          * FEATURES *
                          ************

There are teleporters that transport you around the level, and
barriers that block your progress.  These barriers are deactivated
by pressing buttons of the same color.  Activate buttons and
teleporters by pressing down while touching them.  Monsters can
turn the barriers on and off by moving over colored floor switches. 
There are moving platforms and ladders that can help or hinder you. 
Icy bricks make it hard to walk, and some bricks are covered with
sludge, slowing your progress.  Monster Stunners, Shields, and fuel
appear randomly for a quick player to retrieve.  The Stunners make
the monsters harmless and paralyze them momentarily.  Shields
protect you from monsters, spikes, and all other hazards.

Jetpack contains a full-featured level editor so you can create and
share thousands of customized levels.  In the original Jetpack, you
can play these levels in a full game from the main menu, just press
F4 and select 'customized'.  You can find lots of homemade levels
to add to your collection on national Bulletin Board Systems, and
the Software Creations BBS.  You can test levels in the editor with
F2.

The level editor is one of the most exciting features in Jetpack. 
With it you can create thousands of your own levels to play and
share with friends.  Press [ENTER] for a layout of all 120 tiles
available for level construction.  Use the arrow keys to choose a
tile and then place it in the desired location with [SPACE].  The
joystick can also be used.  A quick way to pick a tile is to move
the cursor on to one that is already on the level screen and press
[INSERT] to pick it up.  A shortcut key for putting down background
tiles (erasing) is [DELETE].  This key is also used to erase
monsters and other objects.

If you're having trouble getting started on a level, press [R] to
randomly scatter your selected tile.  This will give you a
foundation around which to create a level.  The Block function also
helps in level construction.  Block works like the Block option in
most word processors.  Press [B] to mark the starting point of the
block, then move and press [B] again to mark the endpoint.  The
rectagonal area you have just selected is now saved in memory.  You
can press [P] to paste it down with the top-left at your current
cursor location.  Press [F] to fill the entire blocked area with
your selected tile.  Press [C] to clear the entire level.

There are eight types of monsters that you can use to make your
levels more challenging.  You can place up to 20 monsters in each
level, by pressing [1] to [8] for the monster type.  The monsters
are listed at the bottom of this page.

Before testing your level, you must set the starting location with
[S] and the location of the door with [D].  Test your level by
pressing [F2].

For the File Options menu, press [TAB].  From here you can choose
to [S]ave your level, [L]oad a level, [D]elete a level from disk,
or view a level with [ENTER].  Press [ESCAPE] to return to the
editor.

** NOTE **
In this Christmas Jetpack Special, you have complete access to all
of the editor functions, but you can only save one level.  For
information on how to create and collect thousands of homemade
levels, see 'Ordering Information.'

If you need help recalling these commands, press [F1] for help.

debugging and they remain hidden in the program!

By the way, there's a secret cheat key in Christmas Jetpack that
will help you through those tricky levels.  In any level, hold down
the [BACKSPACE] key, and ['] (apostrophe).  This will skip to the
next level.  Use it wisely, because this magic combination can only
be used twice in a game for each player!
