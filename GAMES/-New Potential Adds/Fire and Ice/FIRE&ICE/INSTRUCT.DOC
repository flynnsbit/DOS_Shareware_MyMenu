	Introduction
	------------
	Welcome to Fire and Ice.

	This file contains information that you may want to print out
	and refer to, rather than try to memorise.

	The Story so Far
	----------------

	Suten quietly congratulated himself. This was the perfect
	place to hide. Already worshipped by the indigenous Human
	population, he could remain here undisturbed. He needed to
	rest for some time, it had been a long journey; over 12
	light years across the coldness of space.  Here he could
	absorb energy from the heat of the midday sun, and it was
	very hot here. He began to make plans for his takeover of
	this small planet, all he needed now was time to replenish
	his energy.  He laughed out loud as he recalled the moment
	of his escape from his prison of two thousand years.  It
	had been very easy, he thought. The guards had become very
	slow and lethargic, they had made mistakes. He knew they
	would, after all, he had time to wait, nothing but time.

	Glemm had picked up the trail at last. It had taken a
	while, but he knew that somewhere there would be evidence
	of the vast expense of the magical energy required to
	transport his old enemy away from this place. How could
	they have let him escape, he wondered? He called upon the
	elemental forces to begin the chase.  He would have to be
	careful, Suten was dangerous.  He would have no qualms
	about starting a full-scale elemental battle wherever he
	was, and at any cost to his surroundings.  Glemm remembered
	how an entire solar system had been destroyed prior to
	Suten's capture. That was why he had been incarcerated for
	the remainder of his existence.


	The trail led to a small blue-green planet, the third of
	nine orbiting a yellow star. Suten was bound to be
	somewhere in the hotter regions. Fire had always been his
	favourite elemental force.  It was more destructive than
	the others.  This was not going to be easy. Direct
	confrontation would be disastrous for all the lifeforms on
	the planet. No, there had to be another way. Glemm needed
	an agent, someone whom he could help to defeat Suten
	without arousing too much suspicion.

	Who would be the best choice? Certainly not a
	Human, they were far too stupid and clumsy. They
	couldn't hero their way out of a paper bag. The
	sort of hero required needed to be smart, cunning,
	fast and willing to travel!
	.
	.

	Glemm began his search near the northern polar ice cap.
	There weren't many suitable candidates here at all. He
	could feel Suten's evil magic even here; he  didn't
	have long.

	Many of the less intelligent creatures were already
	behaving aggressively towards each other; on a path of
	certain self-destruction. Where was the hero he needed?
	Walruses? Too slow! Peskimos? Too stupid!  He focused on a
	small igloo, hearing the distant sound of music.

	He had chanced upon the home of one Cool Coyote. He
	couldn't risk direct contact. His materialisation would
	almost certainly be detected by the rejuvenated Suten. He
	would have to help this hero in more subtle ways...

	Controls

	Default keys are:-

		Q=Up, A=Down, O=Left, P=Right and SPACE=Fire.

	These can be redefined from the Game Options menu, or by
	pressing F1 at most times during play and selecting the
	Redefine Keys option.


	Press fire to launch your default weapon, a small
	ice pellet.  Hold fire to launch your current
	Special Weapon if you have one.  Don't hold fire
	for too long if you dont want to exhaust your
	supply of Special Weapons. Duck and hold fire to
	launch a Snow Bomb. Up to seven of these can be
	carried at once.

	Player Options
	--------------

	At most times some game options can be selected by
	pressing one of the following Function keys:-

	F1 - Main Game Options selection. Also Save Game.

	F2 - Toggle Music on or off

	F3 - Toggle Sound FX on or off

	If you wish to save your game positions you should press F1
	whilst playing the game and select Save Game (this options
	will not be available unless you are playing the game). It
	does not matter when you save your game position, as the
	information saved is your score, lives weapons etc. at the
	start of the current Land on the current Level.

	Weaponry
	--------

	Cool Coyote's main weapon is an ice pellet; a small round
	lump of ice which can freeze enemies. More than one hit may
	be required to do this. Hit fire to launch an ice pellet at
	the enemies. Secondary, special weapons may also be
	obtained.  Metal discs can be found lying around, which
	have symbols showing their function. Touch the discs to
	pick them up. They turn blue and move to the top right of
	the screen to confirm that they have been collected. The
	special weapon display will then show a smaller version of
	the symbol.  Up to three weapon discs are displayed,
	showing the last three shots of the weapon. Some may only
	start with one or two shots, some have more.

	Picking up another disc of the same type as that already
	held will accumulate shots, whereas picking up a different
	type will replace the old weapon.

	Multiple special weapons discs are contained in bonus ice
	blocks, and crystal orbs.

	More special weapons are revealed as the game progresses.
	You will find such weapons as airbombs, rain clouds,
	shields and the sonic bark!


	Clouds and snow bombs
	---------------------

	When snow bombs are launched these will rise up and give
	all enemies on screen ONE hit, which may or may not be
	enough to freeze them. Snow bombs can be obtained from
	three places:-

	 1 - Clouds. These are the main source, not to be confused
	with thunderheads, which are much more unpleasant.  Firing
	at the fluffy white clouds cools them down. They will start
	to rain, hail and then snow. Once snowing they deposit
	large flakes - bombs - to be collected for later use. After
	a while the clouds become stormy and should be avoided if
	you don't wish to be struck by lightning!

	 2 - Bonus ice blocks. These may be visible or hidden and
	instead of special weapons discs, a snow bomb may
	occasionally be released.  

	 3 - Crystal orbs. These behave much like Bonus ice blocks
	and occasionally cough up a snow bomb too. 

	Even more occasionally all of the above may release a Key
	Part if there are not enough different types of enemy on a
	Level to carry a piece each, although this is only likely
	on the later levels.


	Freezing Enemies
	----------------

	One or more hits from ice pellets or snow bombs is required
	to freeze each enemy. If they require more than one hit
	they will flash white, rather than turn blue and freeze, so
	beware running into them.

	The enemies will stay frozen for a few seconds before
	starting to flash. This indicates that they are thawing
	out. They will then resume their normal activities, but
	beware, they will be more immune to a second freezing.

	In order to eliminate an enemy you must shatter it while it
	is frozen (or thawing out - risky but possible) by walking
	or jumping into it. The puppies can also shatter enemies.
	Note also that freezing a flying enemy will cause it to
	crash to the ground and shatter.

	At the moment that you shatter an enemy it will reveal a
	key part if it was carrying it, accompanied by a sound
	effect. The key will remain where it was produced until
	Cool Coyote approaches it, whereupon it will chase him
	until picked up.

	   one. A large heart is equivalent to 5 lives.
	3. Day and Night guage. 
	4. Weapons and Snow Bombs available.
	5. Key pieces currently held.


	Getting About
	-------------

	Each of the countries or levels visited by Cool Coyote are
	split into as many as five lands. Some lands are secret
	locations, some have secret areas in them and others may be
	skipped if you find secret exits. It is not necessary to
	visit all the lands to complete the game, but probably
	desirable.

	You are given a percentage of the lands visited with your 
	high score entry so you will know if you missed any. It is
	possible to visit every location in the game, there are no
	either/or situations. To do this though you will have to
	avoid using the shortcuts.

	Exit from most lands will be via the ice door, which Cool
	Coyote must locate on each land. This will be shaped like a
	key-hole. The key to open this has been split into six
	pieces and each piece has been given to one of Suten's
	minion types, e.g.  one of the penguins will have one part
	(always the same part, not always the same penguin!). 

	As our hero collects each part, all currently collected
	parts are shown at the bottom of the screen. Touching the
	exit door with an incomplete key also does this and the
	currently held pieces are always on show on the panel as
	well.  If you have collected all the key parts, touching
	the key-hole will open the door to the next land. Jump
	through the door to get to the next land. Send puppies
	through for extra points.  and/or an extra life.

	Some lands have secret and not-so-secret exits, jumping
	into these will also get to another land, or a secret part
	of the same land.  The full key is not required to do this
	and sometimes this is the only way to collect all your key
	parts for the 'real' exit.


	Ice Steps and bridges
	---------------------

	Situated around the landscape are magical ice switches.
	Step onto them to activate a column of ice steps or an ice
	bridge. These temporarily provide access to other places.
	They slowly melt and finally are unable to support any
	weight. The hotter the land, the quicker they melt.

	Puppies will use the steps and bridges, but you'd better
	lead them away before the ice melts or they could have a
	nasty accident.

	Puppies
	-------

	On many lands, Coyote puppies can be found; possibly
	Suten's minions took hostages to try and slow Cool Coyote
	up. If on screen or just out of sight they will attempt to
	jump towards Cool Coyote for protection. They are too small
	to concern other creatures and will not be hurt by them.
	Like Cool Coyote, they are able to fire small ice pellets,
	and do so when he does.

	Puppies can be led to the exit doorway and through it to
	yield an extra life. One way to do this is to put the exit
	between yourself and the puppy and they will jump towards
	you and...  WHOOSH!

	Puppies are afraid to use moving platforms and cannot jump
	large gaps or into deep holes. They will also wander off if
	left behind. They can be made to jump ahead of Cool Coyote
	by firing rapidly for a short time. This makes the puppies
	feel brave and they will move off in the direction the
	Coyote is facing. Stop firing for a while and they will
	return.

	The puppies can also shatter frozen enemies, and, since
	they can fire ice pellets, are capable of eliminating
	enemies on their own, even if Cool Coyote has been hit.
	Although enemies will ignore the puppies they can be struck
	by lightning and there are a few other hazards you must
	steer them away from, as you will discover.

	Days and Nights
	---------------

	The sky colour changes from day to night every so often,
	and the snowflake an the panel display loses one 'arm' at
	every nightfall. After seven days and nights, Suten the
	Fire Wizard will have detected Cool Coyote's presence and
	hot things up for him. Keep going at this point, and hurry
	to the exit, it only gets hotter from here on.

	Bonus Objects
	-------------

	Many small bonus objects are dotted about each land. These
	may be collected for bonus points and are also accumulated
	towards extra bonuses, such as SnowBombs, Weapons Refilled,
	Extra Lives, an Extra Day and a few others you'll discover.

	They also help to build your score up to get more extra
	lives.

	Extra Lives
	-----------

	Extra lives, indicated by the 1UP symbol are awarded at
	20,000, 70,000, 150,000, 260,000 and 400,000 points. They
	are also obtained by picking up the Bone-us (groan) ice
	bones and by guiding puppies through the exit doors.

	A maximum of nine lives can be carried and any additional
	Bones picked up will add 10,000 points to your score. 

	Special Save Slot
	-----------------

	The Special Save Slot will be used to automatically save
	your game details at the end of each level. This is so you
	can continue to play Fire & Ice from Level Three on the
	Registered version with the lives and score you will have
	built up on the Shareware version.


	That's all folks, so go and play the game.
