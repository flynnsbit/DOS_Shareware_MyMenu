v2.20แ1
  Changed the WFC to FusioN's one screen one.
  When a user is validated by NUV, he will get the proper flags.
  Fixed problem with NUV comments not staying
  Sped up ANSI/AVATAR autodetection
  Sped up Baud Rate detection when you are not running from FD.
  Made it so the BBS will check the current status screen for the ansi
  for a pulldown menu and then check the textfile directory.  So the sysop
  could allow the user to use different pulldowns in accordance to their
  selected status screens.
  Two new ACS codes:
    Hx where the ACS Code is true if the user is using menu set x
    Ix where the ACS Code is true if the user is using status screen set x
  I think I fixed the email corruption bug.  Run EP.EXE and hopefully, no
  more email will get crossed.
  Made it so in the user listing in the editor, unvalidated users will be
  highlighted.
  Made it so the BBS will exit with the proper errorlevel with errorlevel
  events.
  Run DATACON.EXE, I need to add in some room to the data area record.
  Made it so Newscanned Message Bases will not appear with mandatory
  newscans
  Wrote DATAMAIL.EXE data area import/exporter so you can now echomail data 
  areas (BBS Lists, rumors) through echomail.
  Made it so scrollback buffer will not delete lines from ansis.

v2.20แ2
  When a message was upload in QWK or by file in an EchoMail base,
   --- Oblivion/2 x.xx would appear, not --- Oblivion/2 vx.xx
  Sped up ObvMail importer.
  Fixed baudrate detection problem
  New command:
    {D - If user can log on with account and pass (does not need system
    password), failflag is set to false, otherwise set to true.
  Wrote POINTFIX.EXE.  This should fix newscan pointer problems several
  people have been having.  I have not tested this program very much.
  If it does not work, it can do a lot more damage than it is supposed to
  fix.  Only run it if NEWFIX does not solve your newscan pointer problems.
  Before you run it, back up STATS., USER.LST, POINTERS. (The program does
  that for you as well) before you run it and if it does not work, copy the
  files you backed up back.
  Anyway, this version should be stable enough to run without problems until
  I am through with finals.  Let me put it this way, I am underestimating
  finals in a big way and I need to do well on them.  I have some time to
  study, but sysoping takes up quite some time, so I don't think another
  Beta will come out until after June 10.  Thats when I go on summer
  vacation and I'll start really working on v2.20.  It seems like I added some
  stuff and am stabilizing it now.  We may do this repeatedly with v2.20 Betas
  if I am to incorporate all of the recent suggestions.

v2.20แ3
   Possibly eliminated all of the chat lockups.
   I think I actually fixed Email crossing.  I found something in the mail
   forwarding that was definitely screwed up.  Run EP.EXE and see if
   anything gets messed up.
   Made it so QWK will really not update newscan pointers id QWK download
   is unsuccessful.
   Made the upload checker detect errors from the virus scanner and the
   archive tester.
   Made it so the BBS will drain the input buffer when a QWK d/l is selected
   before prompting for protocol key.
   If the user gets dropped into the BBS via {S or {X and there are commands
   after {S or {X in the stack, they will be ignored
   Added in configurable QWK make screen, QWKDN.ANS that is part of the
   status screen libraries, the codes are as follows:
     |L1 - Light #1, Creating control file
     |L2 - Light #2, Creating door information file
     |L3 - Light #3, Conference light

   Added in configurable QWK process screen, QWKUP.ANS that is part of the
   status screen libraries, the codes are as follows:
     |BP - Base Place
     |SP - Sent to Place
     |TP - Title Place
     |OP - Operation Place

v2.20แ4
  Made it so system stats show files today for files and posts today for
    posts.
  Fixed the bug where when paging and you chatted, chat would not start
    until after the paging.
  Sped up data area data listing
  Made it so ^Y in the FSE will go to the beginning of the line
  Made it so 8 and 2 work in the newscan config.
  The BBS now tells the baud rate of the user once he gets to the matrix.
  Made it so certain error messages in the file listings will show up in
    the right place.
  Added in QWK scan limiter date which when you made a QWK packet will exclude
    new messages earlier than date.  No matter what, you will not see old 
    messages.
  New Command: QD, will update last read message to the first message
    after date specified.
  Added an option to toggle free space checking from the WFC which tends to 
    screw up LANs.
  In Minidos user is allowed to type CD.. and DIR /W
  Last call date/time is now set to the time of login so users who stay
    on through midnight, will get new time.
  New Menu Command:
    -#, sets timeleft to value in the CString
  Fixed DataMail Purge
  Made List ACS control access for listing an area.  It did just about
    everything else
  New Menu Command
    F= - Toggles Scrollable file listing,
    also, if CString is Y then Scrollable file listing is turned on
    and if Cstring is N Scrollable file listing is turned off.
  New option at config screen
    T for toggle scrollable file list, pipeSF is the pipe code
  Added in Alt-O, Toggle Input Time-out to help screen
  New ACS Code:
    Jx which is returned true if the user has Ansi and x is 0 or the user
    has AVATAR and x is 1.

v2.20แ5
  Made "Invalid Filename" while uploading prompt configurable.
  Fixed file listing bug.
  Fixed file newscan/lastcall date screw up.

v2.20แ6/7
  Made split screen chat more code-efficient and hopefully fixed the
    lockup/hangup/reboot bug.  I may have caused some bugs, so watch for 
    them.
  Made K for each point method of file valuing instead of points per 10k
    Give the value you want in the config and reassign points in each
    conference
  In the case that a sysop has a file entering ansi when a user enters
    ? at the file entering and gets a listing, when the screen redraws,
    everything is messed up.  A new prompt that will be displayed after
    a listing after a ? at the file entering prompt
  Made batch menu prompt configurable.  I could make it a real menu though.
  Made file search wildcard/string prompts configurable.
  Made the daily log configurable.  The Ansi files that go into libraries 
    are as follows:
      DAILYSRT.ANS
      DAILYMID.ANS
        Codes:
          |DT = Date
          |NP = New Posts
          |NF = New Files
          |NC = Number of Calls
          |TU = Time Used
          |NU = New Users
      DAILYEND.ANS
  Made Quoting starting and ending strings configurable
  New Codes for status screens:
    %VN - Version Number
    %VD - Version Date
    %TF - Total Files
    %TP - Total Posts
  System Status Screen is now configurable.  The filename is SYSSTAT.ANS
  Made File Information screen configurable.  The filename is FILEINFO.ANS
  and the codes are as follows:
    |FN - Filename
    |UL - Uploader
    |FP - File Points
    |TD - Times Downloaded
    |SZ - Size
  Added configurable protocol listing.  The filenames are as follows:
    PROT?SRT.ANS
    PROT?MID.ANS
      where the codes are:
        |KE - Key
        |DE - Protocol Description
    PROT?END.ANS
    where ? is
      1 for download protocols
      2 for upload protocols
      3 for batch download protocols
      4 for batch upload protocols
      5 for resume protocols
      6 for bidirectional protocols
  Replaced inefficient status screen handler with a new one that is more
    memory efficient.  There will be some problems with the screens though,
    but they will be easily worked out.  The new handler uses heap space,
    but not a whole lot.  You may have to lower your scrollback lines by 
    about 20 lines if you get heap overflow errors.
  Make sure no middle file of any listings are above 16k, if they are,
    there will be serious problems.
  I had to change the |CC in the HDR.ANS so it pads with spaces, not the
    next character
  There is a limit of 1024 bytes of PROT?MID.ANS.  There will be unpredicable
    results if the file is bigger than that.
  Configurable Topten listing:
    TOP-??.ANS

      TOP-11.ANS - Top ten best posters
      TOP-12.ANS - Top ten worst posters
      TOP-13.ANS - Top ten best callers      
      TOP-14.ANS - Top ten worst callers
  Made top ten character configurable.  Set it in the config.
  Configurable Email Header

      |FM - From
      |DT - Date
      |TM - Time
      |ST - Sent to

        |D? - Description for option number ? in the line
     The limit for the size of GENMID.ANS is 2048 bytes
    GENEND.ANS
   Much thanks to Mercury for the idea of the configurable generic menus.
  Fixed hangup after chat bug.
  Added in option to read the menu libs for the generic files.  If they are not
    found there, the status screen libraries will be read.  This is so generic
    menus can be implemented as menu sets.  To create them as such, you can just
    run MENUCODE filename directory /G to only code the generic menu files.
  If you are using menu libs for the generics, you can override the options
    per line in the config by beginning the menu filename with the number of
    opts per line you want.
  Fixed problem with local node.

v2.20แ8
  STATCODE now codes the correct files for outgoing email listing
  External Protocol Listing no longer displays the Codes in addition to the
    info
  Fixed run-time error 200 in file adding.
  Fixed Dir /W in Minidos
  Added in File Area Multipliers.  A value set will be multiplied by the file
    points of the files in that area.  With this you could make file areas
    that have files worth no points as well as those worth 10 times the value
    from the size.  Run SETFAM.EXE to set all the values of the FAMs to 1. 
  Added in free file areas where every file is free
  Added in free files to the file record so specific files can be free.  If
    a file area is free, every file in the area will be free independant of 
    how the file is set.
  I think I fixed the ObvMail import corruption bug.
  Fixed Qfilenam.ext extraction quit bug.
  Users that check or try to login that don't have accounts are logged.
  Fixed problem with infoforms clearing when K is typed in the user editor,
    but user is not deleted.
  Added in Deleted List:
    Run BLACKCON.EXE
    The deleted list is a flexible blacklist.  Users have a file displayed to
      them when they try to apply or check.  Their handle can be removed from
      the deleted list, after they try to apply or check, after a certain date,
      or never.  When users are deleted by NUV, they see a file called
      NUVDOWN.ANS that is located in the textfile directory.  There is a
      new option in the config for how many days a user will be on the deleted
      list after being voted down by NUV.

v2.20แ9
  Fixed bug with screwed up daily log listing
  Fixed user editor delete user scrolling bug.
  Oblivion/2 now uses a file catalog for quick look up if you chose to use it.
  The list is generated if it does not exist, if you kill an area, or reorder 
  areas.  The catalog is changed when files are added, moved, and deleted.
  I know Oblivion/2 isn't the first software with such a feature, but it is
  the first one in which that idea works well.  
  New Menu Command:
    TG - Generate File Catalog
  Changed the way logging works.  This will make sure that the log viewing 
    from other nodes work.  Keep an eye out for bugs introduced by that.
  Fixed PCR in topten.
  Message reading will update your last read pointers as it should
  Node Number now appears on the status line in boards set for multinode
   operation
  Fixed event editor add/delete so it behaves better and doesn't nuke events.
  BBS Saves user record before computing topten thus making sure the most
    current stats appear
  NUV deleted user was not being added to the deleted list, this has been
    corrected
  When a sysop vetos NUV and deletes the user, the user is deleted and the
    file that blames deletion on the voters is used
  NUV Vetos are now logged as such
  When a file was added to batch, the user jumped conferences and extracted
    the file with the corresponding number and area in the current conference
    would be used, this has been fixed
  Added in quote headers.  They can be toggled in the config
  Added in option to use greater than sign in quoting
  When the fields of a file are changed by the sysop, they are updated
    in the editor correctly
  The FileMail is now not deleted until it is successfully transfered.
  Decided to make the history file contain only the changes since the last
    release
  Removed ANSI+ to clear things up since it never worked
  When a file is moved between file areas with different File Area
    Multipliers, the uploader's credit is adjusted accordingly
  Fixed file point commission so it works if the commission percent is less
    than 100.
  At upload status screen, up to 45 characters of file description can be
    entered, I don't know how the screen will look afterwards however,
    someone check it out
  Fixed the message capture lock up bug.
  Oblivion/2 will now advance a line when user joins normal multinode chat
  After /U in FSE cursor is put in correct place
  Fixed bug with reverse colors in file listings
  Fixed bug where first letter of word was cut off when word was wrappe

v2.20แ10
  Fixed file adding bug where files were not being added unless catalog
    searches were on.
  Fixed bug where user was being sent to garbage file area after catalog 
    generated
  Made it so the catalog would not be generated when files are moved or deleted
    since the BBS takes care of that
  Added an option in the configure the number of lines per node in the
    real time multinode chat
  Killed Celerity pipe codes in messages since they would make RIP support
    a total pain
  Added in RIP Detection, I set the detection timeout to 1.2 seconds, if that
    is too small and RIP is not detected, let me know.
  The J ACS Code now functions as follows:
    Yes if user has ansi as emulation and value at right is 0
        or user has avatar and the value at right is 1
        or user has rip and the value at right is 2
  Made it so the mouse can be used in the pulldowns via RIP
  That's about it for RIP and although this may not seem a lot, it leaves an
    unbelievable amount of flexibiility to the sysop.  SearchLight (which was
    among the first RIP supporting softwares) is just adding in RIP generic
    menus which you can add, and the whole operation only took a couple of 
    hours.
  Fixed the bug with the wrong SUBS.X is to be viewed
  Made it so FAM defaults to 1 when file area created
  New code in FILEINFO.ANS, |FK, size in kilobytes
  Qwk generation can be aborted by hitting escape twice
  Oblivion/2 will now run any events that need to be run right after the user
    logs off and before the BBS exits back to the front-end.

v2.20แ11
  Made it so the RT would not appear if the BBS did not know the message to
    which the message being displayed was a reply.
  Fixed it so the pipes were preserved if something that was not a code
    followed so RIP would work
  Fixed bug where BBS would exit with errorlevel of 255 even when run with
    the -A option when an event run was done (Merci beaucoup a` Judas pour
    decouvre cet un)
  Fixed bug with the file area where when a file was found in the catalog,
    the file was appropriated to the wrong area
  Fixed bug where ANSI is turned off when RIP is turned on
  Added in Look and Feel configuration into the config to make things more 
    organized
  Fixed multinode chat endless clearing bug
  Oblivion/2 now rounds correctly for time and file points
  Improved file moves so they work better and fiels that fail the upload
    check are moved and if that does not work, deleted
  Increased RIP Detection time to 1.8 seconds
  The BBS now displays 0 as the file points of a free file
  Eliminated need for MA (Close bases command) and without it, message bases
    should not overwrite
  Fixed an autodeleting multinode bug where it would not delete the right
    messages
  Fixed a bug if a message was the last in a base and then was deleted and it
    was last read, the next message in the base would already be considered
    read by users
  Run SETIDS.EXE or no new messages posted will be marked as new
  Finally fixed SUBS.X
  Fixed bug where users voted down would overwrite others in deleted list
  Emailing is now logged
  New Menu Command:
    -O, displays file with the name of CString in menu library
  When a file fails the upload checks, a message is sent to the sysop in
    the notices.  Anything else that could be useful for the sysop can be
    added, tell me what is desired
  Made enter comment for NUV prompt configurable.  Tell me what other
    strings you want configurable and I'll make sure they are
  Multiple message headers per status screen set can be used.  All that
    has to be done is put a CString greater than 1 on the MH command,
    and the bbs will display HEADER.X where X is the number.  If the
    number is 0, the internal header is displayed, if it is 1,
    HEADER.ANS is displayed
  You can now put a CString on the [V (Daily Log) Command for the number
    of days you want displayed
  Fixed Origin Line shadow in message base editor
  I misdocumented an MCI Code, the one for size in K of a file is pipeSK

v2.20แ12
  Really fixed split screen multinode chat
  Fixed weird screen clearing when J is used in the file area editor
  Made an option in the event editor whether or not to limit user's time, it
    defaults to no now, but it limited none the less before, so be sure you
    turn it on if you had events made for the sole purpose of limiting time
  NOTE:
    The time limiting only effects code execution and errorlevel events.
  New Command line option -L, local logon
  If you didn't run SETIDS.EXE immediately after getting แ11 and some bases
    are screwed up, run FIXIDS.EXE which will fix the problem
  Fixed interdirectory physical move
  Added REP dupe checking
  I fixed a bug that would prevent the BBS from going to the correct message
   in a newscan.  I may have introduced others however
  Fixed a bug where free files were checked for K ratio
  Logs message/file confs that are newscanned
  If search all is off in the config, the BBS will not search the file
    catalog for the file, only the current area
  New MCI Codes:
    %CF - Current File Conference
    %CM - Current Message Conference
  Oblivion/2 now creates a semaphore file when there is mail that needs to
    be exported called MAILOUT. in the BBS Directory
  There is now a separate prompt for enter extended description for the
    upload status screen.
  Made it so a user can abort QWK packet d/l by typing ESC twice even when
    the mailer is passing through a base with no messages
  New key: Alt-Q, display KICKOFF.ANS, waits until output buffer clears
    and drops carrier
  New Menu Command:
    -Z, waits until output buffer is empty
  Added prompt to display .QWK file size.  You have to set it to get it to
    display
  If a user reading messages is forced into multinode chat, the BBS will
    enter chat from the newscanning prompt.
  Added in ACS user must have before he/she is asked if he/she wants to be
    available for multinode chat.  If the user does not have the ACS to be
    asked, the user will be put down as not available
  User is now allowed to enter the correct number of characters for filenames
    at the options in the file menu.
  BBS no longer clears the screen before the message/file scanning prompts,
    you can put that in by including a |CS in the prompt
  If the user uploads a file already online, the BBS should detect the file
    and delete it.  Test this please.
  I think I may have fixed some of the newscan pointer screw ups.
  Fixed infoform chat run-time error bug

v2.20แ13
  I think I fixed the newscan pointer screw-ups.  I'm not certain, but this
    should do the trick
  Fixed file adding bug when catalog was on
  Oblivion/2 will now look for KICK-OFF.ANS in the textfile directory
  Oblivion/2 now reports the correct conference in the logs when global
    newscanning is enacted.
  Fixed user overwrite in deleted list
  I think I fixed the doors
  Fixed redraw after chats so it redraws the entire screen
  Oblivion/2 now determines the user number for new users by looking at the
    user index file
  Added in option to use/not use PRELOGON.ANS(X)
  Added un option to use/not use WELCOME.X
  Sped up message base creation
    There is a new MBP included.  This should do the job quickly, but it may
    cause some weird problems.  Let me know about them.
  You can put a ; after the header for the topten and the BBS will not pause
    after displaying the topten.  The ; will not be displayed.
  Made it so message capture will capture entire message
  BBS deletes .QWK file before zipping up the .QWK, so old and new .QWKs will
    not be combined
  BBS now checks to see if a file's name is valid before trying to run
    the upload checker
  Made some changes that should greatly increase display speed.  I had an
    if statement to check if a character was a backspace and do the appropriate
    action on the screen while the BBS was already parsing for ^H in just
    about every output function.  Should make a noticable difference.
  New Menu Command:
    -+ Displays random WELCOME.X file
    -| Makes sure user has all infoforms filled out, if not makes them fill
      out the forms
    -@ Reads Notices
    MZ Executes News Scan
    -_ If User is wanted, sysop is paged
    &[ Set User as Available for Chat
    &] Set User as Not Available for Chat
  Added in option to System Options II:
    Special Login, make sure this is no.
    This option if on, will make it so the BBS will not do the regular login
      options such as displaying the welcome, email scanning, etc.  This
      option lets you have custom logins.  If you want to duplicate precisely
      the BBS's usual login for modification later, add the following commands
      to the _Beginning_ of the top menu:
        Command 1 {Displays Welcome}
          CKeys: -+
        Command 2 {Displays Status Screen}
          CKeys  : -N
          CString: STATUS.ANS
        Command 3 {Hit Return Prompt}
          CKeys  : -(
        Command 4 {Read Notices}
          CKeys  : -@
        Command 5 {Sets User as not available for multinode chat}
          ACS    : [
          CKeys  : &]

  Made the following strings configurable:

    Use Yes/No Bars

v2.20แ14
  DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME I'VE HAD TO WORK ON Oblivion/2 lately next to
    none of these additions have been tested
  Due to a conflict, the no pause topten heading ending has been changed
    to *
  You can now access files that have @ in the name
  If the board is registered, the correct info now appears in the . screen
  Added in new ACS Options for almost all //\\X?, so sysops can give cosysops
   access to some //\\'s, but not all.
  New Menu Command:
    NY - Returns failflag if current base is not in newscan
  New commands from message read menu, F and X, forward/backward title scan
    with advance/retreat, finally
  New Menu Commands
    NF - Forward Title Scan with Advance
    NX - Backward Title Scan with Retreat
  Made it so when new mesasge bases are created, the pointers for that base
    are okay and new messages will be seen as new.
  Fixed 32767 File point bug, run TRANSFP.EXE or every user will have zero
    file points
  Limited number of lines that can be entered in editor to 200 from 250,
    you can still send unlimited number of lines in uploads, QWKS, and nets.
    This should fix the email crossing bug
  Made it so Oblivion/2 does not pause after entry of system password if
    PRELOGON is not to be used
  Oblivion/2 now pauses after showing notices
  Fixed post upload duplicate checking
  Files sent up with errors will be deleted
  Files that need to be resumed will not be sent through the upload checker
  Log off after transfer now takes place before the upload checker is run
  J in the file area newscanning should jump to the next area
  New Menu Command:
    FG - Custom File Operations
    Lets say you want users to do certain things to certain files that is not
      already covered in Oblivion/2, this option is for you.  It generates
      a list of files selected (With path) in the work directory, called
      FILELST and then calls a specified batch file.  The format for the
      CString is
      operation name,batchfile
      The batchfile is called with the parameter of the work directory
      For example if I wanted the BBS to zip all files that a user selects
        into a certain file, I'd do it like this:
      FG w/ CString of Zip together,DOZIP.BAT
      The BBS would ask for up to 50 files to zip together, the batch file
      DOZIP.BAT which is in the BBS directory would read as this:
        C:\OBV\PKZIP.EXE %1WHATEVER.ZIP @%1FILESLST.
      When called it would look this:
        C:\OBV\PKZIP.EXE C:\OBV\WORK\WHATEVER.ZIP @C:\OBV\WORK\FILESLST.
    This option can be used for many things, the intended purpose is to
      allow the user to provide an interface with the tape door
  Added option to toggle G and I message commands which lock some systems
  Made it so you can go back a page in the scrollable file listings
  Added Alt-Q to help
  Made it so exit from Help and F3 user editor redraw current screen even
    if BIOS writes are on
  Made it so when the BBS runs events that needs it, it will continue until
    all that need it have been done
  Tweaked the events a bit, there should be no more event skipping.  By
    the way, did anyone hear me explain, I've been doing really cool drugs.
    I don't remember doing drugs, not do I think I would, but if I did them,
    it was when I was programming the events.

  I'm a little disappointed in how things are going.  Not in everyone else,
    but myself.  Now that we have a powerful BBS laid done, there are few
    necessary major additions needed.  There are however many minor things
    that need to be added.  My suggestion file is over 500 lines, I can polish
    away about 7 or 8 an hour, but its boring and tiring work.  I would have
    liked to have gotten more done, but its tough to drag yourself in front
    of a slow 286 to code after having already spent some time on the speedy
    486 running the exciting board.  I don't intend to stop writing
    Oblivion/2, but its very difficult to get a lot done while going to high
    school and college, running a board, running a net, and hubbing 2 others.
    I have people demanding a release and we owe it to ourselves to get a
    stable release out, but its tough when there is so much to do.  There's no
    real point to this statement, but stick with it.

v2.20แ14Fix1
  Fixed Event Reading Bug

v2.20แ15
  Fixed endless event bug
  Fixed log updating bug
  If user logs off after transfer, BBS takes phone off the hook before
  continuing to do upload checking
  Sysops can type I at the NUV prompt to display other infoforms
  New Menu Command:
    -X returns failflag if file specified by CString does not exist
  Made it so if > are not used in quoting and an origin line is quoted,
    the --- will be changed to -*- prevent the tag line cut-off bug
  Fixed bug with BBS extracting the wrong file
  I think I fixed the weird % Download Status bug
  New ACS Codes:
     Q - Number of Calls
     R - Total Number of Calls

v2.20แ16
  Much thanks to Foxpass who's nagging and bug finding has helped this
    version greatly.  If not for him, I don't know if v2.20แ16 would come out
    at this, however delayed date.
  Fixed bug where EVENTS.DAT was left open when it should have been closed
  Fixed slow wildcard search bug
  When Oblivion/2 is unable to create swap directory, it will report that
    instead of unable to create work directory.
  New command line parameter -d, doesn't check for work/swap directory
    existence so you won't get locked out of your board if it can't create
    those directories.
  Fixed bug where files were left open when adding a file
  I think I fixed the daily log minutes bug, thanks to Spyder
    Man for discovering the cause
  Fixed bug where users at matrix were seeing messages intended for the
    previous user on that node
  The correct number of file points is displayed in status screens now
  Oblivion/2 now displays the correct infoform when I is used at NUV menu
  Quoting change the " * " in origin lines to " X " to mailer does not cut
  off the message at that point
  You can include N in the CString of the [C command and the BBS will not ask
    for a reason
  After WFC operations, the node is set back to being Waiting for Call
    in the multinode status
  Added in Multiple Infoform sets.  The user can still only have 5 infoforms,
    but they are not the same 5 infoforms for all users.  The -> command is
    used to set the infoform name to the CString (it defaults to INFOFORM
    though) and the user will be forced to fill out the infoforms which begin
    with the Inofofrm name.  Thus you can have separate sets of infoforms for
    users and can have a PD front without giving away what the board is
    through Infoforms that ask for definitions, wares, etc.
    Run SETINFN.EXE to set everyone's infoform to INFOFORM
  Screen is no longer cleared after user enters system password regardless
    of whether PRELOGON is used or not.
  Oblivion/2 no longer clears the screen before prompting for handle if
    external file USERLOG is used
  New Command line parameters:
    -T xxxx where xxxx is the time in minutes after midnight before which
      users should be kicked off
    -M xxxx where xxxx is the number of minutes to the next event before
      which the user must be kicked off
  You can now specify the entry to show or delete in the CString of the DD and
    DS commands.
  If you put L as the name in prompt for a pulldown menu, Left with be
    interpreted as Up, Right will be interpreted as down
  Previously undocumented feature:
    If the pulldown filename is set to N, there are two more possible name
      in prompt endings:
        # - Get a character
        ) - Get a character and echo it to the screen
  Changed ) at the end of Name in Prompt so that it will only echo the
    character back if it is a regular low-ASCII character
  Note:
    You can put the following characters in the keys of a menu using a
      Name in prompt ending with # or )
        Alt-200 - Up
        Alt-208 - Down
        Alt-205 - Right
        Alt-203 - Left
        Alt-199 - Home
        Alt-207 - End
  Added option so BBS does not hang up on callers (to be used when BBS is run
    as door).  You need to run an option which defaults to false to on so
    your board will continue to hang up on callers.  It is in system options 2,
    REMEMBER TO SET IT.
    BBS will still drop carrier on users if they tell it to log off after a
    transfer or if they are kicked off by a sysop.  It will also do that if
    they have a slow baud rate since if they can't access the BBS, they
    shouldn't have access to try.  In addition it will do this if the user
    ends up calling in the middle of an event, of course if Oblivion/2 is
    run as a door, there should be no events that would kick off the users.
  Fixed bug where files would be displayed in the file area in lowercase
  When files are sorted by uploader, the sort will no longer be case-
    sensitive.
  New Menu Command:
    FW - List users with access to current file area
  Oblivion/2 now allows a configurable file to be displayed when ? is typed
    at the file listing or message reading prompt.  The filenames are 
    FILEHELP.ANS and MESHELP.ANS, and the option to use them is at the look
    and feel menu.
  Sped up QwkMail uploads by only having BBS update total number of messages
    at the end
  In QwkMail uploads, the number of posts today is updated
  New codes for the Infofoms:
    %XX - Accepts up to XX characters, repeats if nothing is entered
    @   - Gets Input, repeats if nothing is entered
  The (Y/n) characters in the new user application can be turned off by
    an option in look and feel.  It defaults to no, and you probably want
    it on
  Made it so the deleted list type was no longer case sensitive
  Users can no longer stay on past events by uploading and using the time
    reimbursement
  New Menu Commands:
    EI - Lists Incoming Mail
    EO - Lists Outgoing Mail
  New Option in System Info 2, you can tell the BBS to generate a door file
    before running MAINTAIN.BAT.  The file will be DORINFO1.DEF-type, but I'll
    support others if they prove necessary.  The file is created in the door
    directory, so if you are running multinode, you'll need to match the
    parameter with the possible work directories to locate the file
  Added in System Information 3, the first options there allow you to configure
    where you want the BBS to swap when it shells.  The changes you make to
    these options do not take effect until the BBS has been loaded again
  In the Archive editor, you can now set the maximum errorlevel which will be
    returned by the CRC verification in the upload checker and still pass.
    This was added as a remedy to the problem in which files with an
    authentication check failed, although more likely than not a zip ad was 
    responsible.  This problem can beremedied by raising the maximum OK CRC to
    1
Note: All I need to add is the unlimited file description and we're ready for
  release.

v2.20แ17
  Fixed a bug with the ACS events not limitting time properly.
  Made it so you can access time bank if you have files in your batch,
    since the time will be checked again when you go to download the files
  Fixed bug where if you had less than 10 users, you'd see pipe codes in the
    top-ten listing
  You can now put %XX in place of |XX in data area entry adding ansis and
    there will be mandatory entry
  Fixed bug where if % was used in infoforms, the filled in infoform would
    not display properly
  Really fixed slow wildcard search bug
  Fixed check account ANSI screw up bug
  New Menu Command TH - Pack File Description File, should be done nightly
  Made it so correct infoform is displayed in NUV when the sysop presses
    I.
  File Descriptions are now stored in a separate file.  You can enter up to
    8 lines as a user and the DIZ can be as big 20 lines.  I can expand this
    at any time however.  These were just convenient values.  You need to run
    FCON.EXE, please make a backup of your FILES directory before running it.
    Some things may be unstable with the file descriptions, so I added in
    some extra info so I could write a file description reattacher if need be.
    The description form is just appended onto the file description, so please
    edit your description forms, because |Dx and |Xx is no longer needed or
    supported
  Fixed Pulldown Menu lock up bug
  New Config option, open/close file description file, this is during file
    listing and if on will slow down file listing considerably.  You should
    only turn this on if you have more than 1 active node
  Fixed memory problem which took place when you tried to Add tagged files
    to batch and the bar had not been moved and no files were tagged.
  Fixed bug where BBS was opening the AREADIR many times when global local
    u/l was done
  If File does not exist, the fact is only shown locally
  Fixed some more instances of lower-case file bug
  I think I fixed the end-less loop multinode real-time chat bug

v2.20แ18
  Fixed major bug in file extraction
  Fixed blank screen file bug
  Make it so description form defaults to blank for new systems
  Fixed some more cases of lowercase file bug
  Added in 21.6k and 28.8k rate detection when board answers on its own
  Increased the delay for RIP detection, it may work now
  Made it so @ would correctly display the forced answer in the infoform
    display
  Fixed wildcard search description display bug
  Fixed complete file list generator
  Fixed regular user change file lockup bug
  Fixed bug where file area file was left open after global local u/l
  Fixed borrowed download bidirection batch bug
  Fixed extra blank lines no DIZ adding/uploading bug
  You can put pipe codes in pulldown menu options to change the color, |- will
    change the color back to the original (highlighted or unhighlighted) color
  Fixed bug where the newscan pointers of a user creating a message base would
    be screwed up
  Temporary sysops cannot see or change the sysop password in the config
  Lowered number of editor lines to 150 to prevent certain memory errors
  BBS restores screen from before for all transfers and archive operations
    including QWK
  Fixed bug where when a file was deleted, it wasn't properly removed from the
    catalog
  New Menu Commands:
    E+ - Makes it so user sees all mail
    E- - Makes it so user sees only mail addressed to them
    E$ - Sets Incoming Tag to value in Cstring (0-255)
    E# - Sets Outgoing Tag to value in Cstring (0-255)
  New Feature:
    Email Tags - You can now give email a certain tag by using the
      below-described menu command to change the tag before the user sends
      mail.  And when you are set to a certain tag, you only see mail that has
      that tag.  So by stacking the outgoing email tag changing menu command
      before the feedback or apply commands, you could ensure that feedback
      or new user application mail has a certain tag.  Then you could switch
      the incoming tag to that value and see only NUA mail or feedback.
      Also added is the menu command to allow the user to see all mail.  I
      intend to use this so both me and my cosysop can read new user
      application mail.  This can be accomplished by stacking E# w/ Cstring
      1 before the apply command and E# w/ Cstring 0 after.  I'll then add
      two menu commands to the email menu, one being E$ w/ Cstring 1 and
      then an E+, the other being E$ w/ Cstring 0 followed by E-.
    Note: When the tag is 0, you can see all mail, regardless of tag.
  Fixed infoform color changing bug
  May have fixed problem with hang up after download abort bug
  Due to a conflict between Turbo Pascal and Norton Cache, I lost all changes
    to the file section since before แ17 was released.  I made the changes
    again, but did not verify them to the degree that I did before, and there
    may be some new bugs.
  Fixed bug where going back a page in the file listings would not go back
    over very long descriptions

v2.20แ19
  Fixed email status inheriting bug that occured on systems not running with
    a front end.
  Fixed endlessly repeating multinode chat bug, really dumb mistake on my
    part.
  I think I fixed RIP detection
  Fixed bug where forwarded mail would inherit the original tag instead of the
    current tag.
  Made it impossible to do the following operations through command
    executions in MiniDos:
      FORMAT
      DEL
      FDISK
      REN (so you can't change FORMAT and FDISK to executable file names)
  Fixed scrolling file listing redraw bug
  Made it so BBS could detect 26400 and 31200
  Fixed some bugs in which manually entered file descriptions would be screwed
    up
  Fixed bug where split screen multinode backspace would not work
  File Description File Pack function will return to original file base and
    conference now
  Improved the way the ACS Parser handles parantheses, it also displays
    'Bad ACS Code' if the number of open parantheses do not match the number
    of closed parantheses.  There may have been some bugs in the handling of
    ~ codes, if there were, they have been fixed 
  Added in lock at 115.2k option.  I may have introduced some bugs along the 
    way however, so please give things a good going-over

v2.20แ20
  New communication option: Wait Until Sent.  This will make the BBS pause
    until the output buffer is empty after transfers.  This may remedy some
    problems encountered while locking at 115.2k.  If this doesn't work,
    I'll simply remove the option however.
  Rewrote a bit of the registration routines.  Figured out how to get certain
    protective measures I had added in earlier to work.  Hopefully, the new
    routines will offer a little more protection than the old ones.
  Made it so it was impossible to overwrite files with the Minidos COPY
    command
  Fixed bug where Q would not exit file change menu
  I think I fixed the message base creating newscan pointer bug
  New Option in Archiver Editor:
    Checker Only, this means the archiver will only be employed in upload
    checking or file viewing.  This will allow archivers that aren't really
    archivers, but are viewers for certain file types.  This can be used to
    add in ACiD's SAUCE ansi commenting standard by using a little program
    to "extract" a DIZ, but in fact read the SAUCE info.  GIF specs are also
    possible.
  Made it so COMMAND.COM could not be run in Minidos
  BBS now logs which node a user logs on to
  New menu command
    -! Displays current menu prompt using CString as name in prompt
  Fixed bug in multinode split screen chat where if a user exited multinode
    chat and someone filled his slot, the other nodes would not see any
    characters until the number of characters entered by the new node
    equals the number that had been entered by the previous resident in
    that slot.
  Made it so file displaying would pay attention to end of file markers
    as not to incidentally display SAUCE information

Here is how the SAUCE reader archiver should work as to get specs from ansis:

RUNSPAN.BAT should be:

ANSVIEW.BAT should be:

TEMPL.ANS could read

Whatever comments

v2.25Pre
  Oblivion/2 will now pay attention to end of file markers when printing
    textfiles
  Oblivion/2 will try 24000 when negotiating connect rate
  If no exec string is defined for archiver operations, the BBS will not
    do the action and report that the action was successful (errorlevel of
    0)
  If the BBS is unable to extract any files from the archive, the file will
    not fail the age test (will work for non-SAUCE'd ansis, encrypted zips)
  Oblivion/2 now checks for multinode messages at promptless, spread bars,
    and one line bar menus.  Still it does not check for them at pulldown
    menus since it may cause some errors in option placement so I have added
    the &H menu command which will check for multinode messages.  You can
    create an EACH command which will execute that command and precede it
    with a cursor placement command.
  Fixed bug where FS file searches would add the file to the batch, but
    record the wrong area number.
  Fixed some more isntances of the file capitalization bug.
  If a bidirectional transfer is unsuccessful, the download batch will still
    be saved.
  Oblivion/2 will now only log the node logged in on if the system is running
    multinode.
  Oblivion/2 now checks for minimum free space before filemail uploads.
  Fixed mail forwarding from the prompt which previously did not deleted
    the piece of mail if told by the user.
  Fixed bug in which forwarded mail would be cut off at the bottom.
  Statcode now codes NUV.ANS into status screen libraries
  Modified New user voting display without NUV.ANS which had :'s that did not
    line up
  Fixed bug in which whether an archiver was Checker Only was not displayed
  Made it so the sysop could not enter wildcards for importing files into
    messages
  You can now put a negative sig location for an archiver and Oblivion/2 will
    count backwards that many characters from the end of the file to look
    for the sig.  I've changed the SAUCE example above to reflect this new
    feature.
