    This upgrade procesure assumes that you have Telemate already installed
    in the directory \TM,

    1. Before you do anything, MAKE A BACKUP of the \TM directory. You WILL
       NEED some files from it later.
    2. Copy all files (or extract them from the .ZIP) to \TM. You can
       overwrite all the files.
    3. Copy the TM.CFG from your backup to \TM and at the DOS prompt run
       "UPGRADE TM.CFG".
    4. Copy the TM.FON and TM.MEM from your backup to \TM.
    5. Delete all *.TMS files.
    6. Run TMINST.EXE to check if all the options are setup correctly.
    7. If you are using the HOST script, you can run HOST.EXE to extract
       the host script, copy the HUSER.HST from the backup to \TM and
       then run the script HCONFIG.SCR to setup the host mode.

    If you want to install v4.11 in a different directory, say C:\TM4,

    1. Copy all the files (or extract them from .ZIP) to C:\TM4.
    2. Copy the TM.CFG from \TM to C:\TM4 and at the DOS prompt run
       "UPGRADE TM.CFG".
    3. Edit TM.CFG and changes the lines to
           DirTelemate="C:\TM4\"
           DirScript="C:\TM4\"
       * It is VERY IMPORTANT that you have the directory set up correctly.
         Otherwise, Telemate will not run.
    4. Edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT and change (or add) the line
           SET TMCFG=C:\TM4\TM.CFG
    5. Copy the TM.FON and TM.MEM from \TM to C:\TM4.
    6. Run TMINST.EXE to check if all the options are setup correctly.

    Notes:
    1. The new *.MAC and *.PAD are not compatible with the old ones. You
       will have to set up your macro again.
    2. If you are using a 101-key keyboard, you should turn ON the 'Enhanced
       Keyboard' option under the Options/Mouse & Keyboard dialog.
    3. The VT102 keypad table is changed in order to emulate the actual
       terminal more accurately. Please refer to Appendix B in the file
       TELEMATE.DOC for details on the keyboard assignment.
