This file describes how to use the music player ROLALARM.EXE as the
external alarm in Telemate.


1. Before you can run ROLALARM.EXE, you must have the following files:

        SOUND.COM       the sound driver for Adlib music card and
                        SoundBlaster music card
        STANDARD.BNK    the music instrument bank
        *.ROL           any ROL music file

   If you cannot find the SOUND.COM or SB-SOUND.COM, you should call
   your dealer or your music card producer for them. Or you can
   download TMALARM.ZIP or .ARJ from our support BBSs:

    Telemate Support BBS   Phone Number  Baud          Location
    컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴  컴컴컴컴컴컴  컴컴컴컴컴컴  컴컴컴컴
    S.R.O. BBS             817-542-7388  28800 DS      Texas
    Terminator BBS!        414-867-3670  28800 DS      Wisconsin
    The Blackboard         914-354-1913  14400 V32bis  New York
    Com-Dat BBS            503-681-0543  14400 V32bis  Oregon

2. You MUST run SOUND.COM or SB-SOUND.COM BEFORE you run Telemate. The
   sound driver is a TSR utility that will stay in your memory. It is
   a good idea to add it to your AUTOEXEC.BAT, for example, add the
   line
        SOUND           or
        SB-SOUND
   in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

3. Choose one of your .ROL music files and copy it to ALARM.ROL in the
   Telemate directory.

4. Copy STANDARD.BNK to the Telemate directory.

5. You should have TMALARM.BAT in the Telemate directory. It is the
   batch file Telemate run when it activates the external alarm.
   In this batch file, you can run anything you like, say a music
   player or a picture viewer, anything.

   Telemate comes with a music player called ROLALARM.EXE. The default
   TMALARM.BAT has the line
        ROLALARM ALARM.ROL /S%2 /T%3
   It tells ROLALARM to play the ALARM.ROL music file. You can replace
   ALARM.ROL with any .ROL music files. Here, we use ALARM.ROL as an
   example.

6. You should have ROLALARM.EXE in the Telemate directory. It is a
   music player that play a .ROL music file. It requires the SOUND.COM
   installed in your memory. And it needs the STANDARD.BNK at run time.
   You should be able to play ALARM.ROL using
        ROLALARM ALARM.ROL
   in the DOS command line.

7. Run Telemate and turn ON the 'External Alarm' option under the
   Options/General dialog.


Now you have installed the ROLALARM.EXE as your external alarm. Since
ROLALARM.EXE requires quite a lot of memory, you may need to turn ON
the 'Swap Telemate to XMS/EMS' or 'Swap Telemate to Disk' options
under the Options/General dialog. This suggests that you should only
use the external alarm if you have XMS or EMS or you have a fast hard
disk.


Have fun and don't be afraid to experience in using the other music
players as your external alarm.
