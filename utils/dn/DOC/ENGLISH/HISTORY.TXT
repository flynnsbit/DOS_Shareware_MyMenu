      text from beginning of line to the very first "space" is regarded as
      name;

[*] Now DN will copy files correctly when "Check free disk space" option is
    selected and 1) insufficient free disk space detected and 2) file already
    exists and 3) file being copied can fit in space only by overwriting old
    file (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[*] Now DN will use LFN only if "Action" input field is empty when creating a
    file list (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

    it was possible to do only by mouse drag-and-drop of current file info.
    Final decision about assigning <Shift-F5/F6> hotkeys to these operations
    are yet to be made (Pavel Borodin).

[*] Now DN windows manager shows window titles of DBF viewer and spreadsheet
    editor correctly (Pavel Borodin).

[*] Now DN loads desktop size more correctly (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[*] Now DN can process PGDN key pressing at the first line of User Menu
    (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[*] Now DN's command line is more comfortable... Again. As it was in original
    DN 1.51 by RitLabs (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[-] DN crashed after deleting all files from archive (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[-] DN crashed during start-up if the archive file (which was opened in file
    manager when DN exited previous session) did not exist anymore
    (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[-] DN crashed after two attempts to move a file with mouse if this file
    already existed in target panel and option "SKIP" was chosen in
    overwrite CONFIRM dialog (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[*] Now logic of moving files with mouse 'drag-and-drop' to DRIVE LINE is
    the same as for standard procedure of moving files (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[*] Now DN does not VERIFY DISK WRITES and does not CHECK FREE DISK SPACE
    in coping to "PRN" or "NUL" devices (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[-] DN crashed at attempt to start an external program if one of DN file
    manager panels was "FIND:" panel or file LIST (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[-] Fixed potential bugs in different file operations in DN file manager
    (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

    >>> Editor and viewer <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[-] Sometimes DOS Navigator did not delete files from %TEMP% after
    viewing (Max Vasilyev).

[-] While executing "Replace all" operation with confirmation after "Cancel",
    the editor did not display the message about the number of the replaces
    made (Alexey Korop).

[*] Now sorting text block in the editor does not sort/permute lines with
    equal keys (Alexey Korop).

[-] In editing a 'Read Only' file (with "File Lock" option active), the
    following sequence: "Save" file (F2), negative answer to request to
    overwrite file ("Cancel"), "Save" file (F2) again - caused DN crash
    (Alexey Korop).

[-] Now changing File Name Case is ignored when saved in history
    (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[*] Now hotkey <Alt-F7> invokes BACKWARD SEARCH in viewer just as in
    editor. Function of hotkey <Ctrl-F7> has not been changed
    (Pavel Borodin).

[-] Now DN more correctly performs selected block calculate
    (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

    >>> System Information <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] AMD Duron and Intel Pentium 4 processors detection (Max Vysokikh).

    >>> Database viewer <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] File with .DBF extension (but not database file in fact) was not opened
    for viewing at all (only by Alt-F3). The repeated viewing of same DBF and
    WKZ files did not restore the cursor and window positions
    (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[-] Now DBF and WKZ files are correctly shown in history
    (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[-] Now horizontal scrollbar does not overlap bottom-right window corner
    (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[-] Internal viewer is not invoked after viewing empty DBF files
    (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[+] Now DBF viewer shows the type and the size of current field
    (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

[*] Now horizontal scrollbar size in DBF viewer is the same as horizontal
    scrollbar size in editor (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

    >>> Archivers <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] RAR 3.0 SFX detection (Max Vasilyev).

[*] Operations with archivers optimized, fixed bugs in processing some types
    of archives (Max Vasilyev).

[*] Now changing an archiver parameters does not set this archiver as default
    for archiving operations (Pavel Borodin).

[-] After moving/copying file into archive DN changed default archiver
    setting to one which archive was used to copy/move files into
    (Pavel Borodin).

[*] Now DN will more correctly archiving files. If single file choosen to
    create archive then DN will use long or short name of this file for
    archive file's name. It's depends on current Files Panel settings:
    Show Long File Name (Eugeny Zvyagintzev).

    >>> Source codes usage features <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[-] Process of copying documentation files into "OUT" (during compilation)
    is now restored (Alexey Nemytov).


   Version 2.0.0
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

[!] Fixed occasional files deleting, hanging at file operations, 'missing'
    files in file panels, improved Novell Netware compatibility. Changes
    information added to the source codes.

    >>> Compatibility issues <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[-] Fixed bug caused DOS Navigator could not work with empty catalogs in
    Novell disks from DOS (Max Vasilyev).

[-] Changed time sharing system in multitasking environments (removed
    EnterCriticalSection and LeaveCriticalSection) (Max Vasilyev).

    >>> DN.INI parameters, setup and options <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] New DN.INI parameter: HistoryButtonChars = string[4], (section
    [Interface]). In this case displaying the history button in dialogs will
    use a limited chars set (like PoorFrames parameter) (Pawel Ziemian).

[+] New DN.INI parameter: SundayFirst = byte (section [Calendar]).
    Value 1 defines Sunday as the first day of week, 0 defines as the last
    one. Value 2 defines automatic detection of this parameter (default)
    (Max Vasilyev).

[+] Added new filenames display mode. Set in menu Options -> File
    Manager -> Column defaults -> (any item) -> Automatic detection.
    The case of filenames in panels is defined so:
    1. If there are letters of one case IN.a.name.BETWEEN.TWO.points,
       then the files names are lowercased, and catalogs names are
       uppercased.
    2. If there are letters of different cases in.a.Name, then it is
       displayed as is.
    This displaying mode formerly was set only in the source codes by
    specifying {$DEFINE COMBINE_MIXED} (Max Vasilyev).

[*] Removed intersected hotkeys in archiving dialog. Some corrections in
    search and replace dialogs in the editor and viewer. Added calling help
    for files columns options dialogs. Added Ctrl-M hotkey for zooming
    window. Added IniFile topic, describing DN.INI structure, to English help
    files. (Pavel Borodin, Max Vasilyev).

    >>> File manager <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] Added mode of sorting files by descriptions (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy).

[*] Now Ctrl-N hotkey is used for toggling long and short names display in
    file panel and Ctrl-Alt-N hotkey is used for network information display
    (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy).

[*] Option for sorting archives before executables in panels added to panel
    options (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy).

[*] If HandleChDirCommand=1 used, the catalog name in CD command will be
    automatically transformed into long. CD /? command is now passed to
    processing by the operation system (Max Vasilyev).

[*] Changed function of hotkey Ctrl-Y: Now it serves for toggling between
    the current (but not only the first one as formerly) and the second (full
    by default) modes of file panels columns (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy).

[*] Now hotkey Shift-Del (for deleting a single file) in file panel does not
    work while '[ ] DEL erases file(s)' in File Manager options is off
    (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy).

[*] Now wildcards like '*.' and 'xxx*.' are interpreted as wildcards of files
    without extensions while searching by a filter and in a file panel filter
    (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy).

[*] The file panel filter correctly accepts (and processes) wildcards with
    extensions exceeding 3 chars length if such files exist
    (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy).

[*] The file panel filter works via long filenames in the long filenames
    displaying mode and via short ones in the short filenames displaying mode
    (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy).

[-] Fixed processing cases of unsuccessful moving files to another disk
    (Aleksej Kozlov).

[-] Fixed processing hotkeys Ctrl(+Alt)(+Shift)+Enter (Max Vasilyev).

[-] Now element '..' cannot be deleted by Ctrl-Del (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy).

[-] Fixed bug caused impossibility of comparing catalogs using all the
    4 comparison criteria simultaneously (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy).

[-] Fixed hanging while viewing catalogs tree. Minor changes in the tree
    displaying: Now catalogs names are not edged with zero chars (which are
    often seen as vile small dots or something worse), now all catalogs of
    one level display aligned by one vertical line not depending on the
    catalogs presence in them (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy).

[-] Fixed bug caused that deleting the zeroth element (current catalog) of
    the catalogs history passed to the history element of the number smaller
    than the selected one by 1 (and selecting the zeroth element simply
    passed to the current catalog) (Alexey Korop).

[-] Not all files displayed in some sorting modes (Max Vasilyev).

[-] Fixed copying catalogs descriptions containing a point in their
    names (Max Vasilyev).

    >>> Editor and viewer <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[-] Fixed back search in view (Marcin Meinardi).

[-] Fixed hanging when changing xlt-table in view (Alexey Korop).

[-] Fixed bug caused going to a bookmark by mouse was impossible if there are
    no the bookmark of the number smaller by 1 (Alexey Korop).

[-] Formerly '!\!.!' wildcards data for viewers, editors and launching by
    extension were transferred in a wrong case. Irrespective of the real one,
    the catalog was uppercase and the filename was lowercase causing problems
    with Java (Aleksej Kozlov).

[-] Fixed functioning of Undo/Redo after saving a file in the editor
    (Max Vasilyev).

    >>> Database viewer <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[-] Fixed databases identification (Max Vasilyev).

    >>> Archivers <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Operations with archivers optimized, fixed bugs in processing some
    types of archivers and also processing archivers without extensions
    (Max Vasilyev).

[-] Fixed archive reading process indication (Max Vasilyev).

    >>> System Information <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Changed detecting hard disks of large sizes (more than 8 Gb)
    (Max Morozov, Max Vasilyev).

    >>> Calculator <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] Values may be entered in scientific form <a>E+<b>, <a>E-<b>
    (Pavel Anufrikov).

[+] Added support of logic functions && and || (Max Morozov).

[*] In calculator entering values of bases 16, 8 and 2 interpreted as
    signless, ie. entering value 0xFFFFFFFF displays not Overflow but
    0xFFFFFFFF in HEX line. Also it works correctly with negative values
    like -0xF8000001 (Max Morozov).

[-] Fixed executing functions OR and XOR (Max Morozov).

    >>> Miscellanous <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] Calendar is completely rewritten. See the detailed information in
    the help chapter about Calendar (Pawel Ziemian).

[-] Fixed program crash after a message about COM port cannot be found
    when opening the terminal window (Max Morozov).

[-] Fixed program crash while copying files (Pawel Ziemian).

    without its English resources (Max Vasilyev).

[-] Fixed bug caused occasional deleting files (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy).

[-] Fixed hanging and occasional creating files in some computers
    (Marcin Meinardi).

    >>> Source codes usage features <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] {$DEFINE COMBINE_MIXED} moved from the source codes to the panel options
    (Max Vasilyev).

[-] Fixed the processors detection library compilation (Max Vasilyev).

[-] Now AsyncPro library may be used in source codes (Max Vasilyev).

[-] Fixed 'broken' possibility of compiling with included PKTVIEW
    (Pavel Borodin).

[!] Changes information added to the source codes.
    It is filled by the COORDINATOR only!


   Version 1.6.RC1 (Release Candidate 1)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    >>> File manager <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Files containing descriptions (descript.ion, file_id.diz) are no more
    excluded from the group selection in Archive, Navigator Link and Arvid
    panels (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[*] Files with both Hidden and System attributes set are now marked with a
    hash character different from those for files with Hidden attribute alone
    and System attribute alone (Pavel Anufrikov)

[-] Destination wildcards containing two '*' signs were handled incorreclty
    when copying, moving and renaming (Pavel Anufrikov)

[-] Panel column setup was reset each time when drive was changed with
    Ctrl-Left/Right (Eugeny Zvyagintzev)

[-] Drive Not Ready error message was shown twice when changing drive with
    Ctrl-Left/Right (Max Vasilyev)

[-] Fixed directory change logic (Max Vasilyev)

[-] Fixed detection of TDR storage catalogues (Max Vasilyev)

[-] Fixed incorrect initialization of Arvid drives (Max Vasilyev)

    >>> Editor and viewer <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[-] After editing a file with more than 65535 lines, DN became unstable
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] When opening a file in Editor, stray empty lines still could appear,
    though in rare cases (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Fixed Indent and Unindent commands having been accidentally swapped in the
    Russian resources for the Editor menu (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] Recalculation of some expressions in the Spreadsheet was broken
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Fixed detection of databases (Max Vasilyev)

    >>> Archivers <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Archivers that do not take the list of files to extract from a list file
    are now invoked multiple times if necessary, so that all the desired files
    are extracted (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[-] Fixed detection of ARJ archives (Max Vasilyev)

[-] Fixed reading of TAR and TGZ archives (Max Vasilyev)

    >>> Miscellanous <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

    the command line. Now this set includes the at-sign '@' (Pavel Borodin)

[-] A number of fixes announced in DN OSP 1.51.12 were actually missing in the
    release. Now synchronized (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] Fixed the behavior of memory-saving configurations with disabled features.
    Such DN configurations are not publicly distributed and one can only make

   Version 1.51.12
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    >>> Compatibility issues <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] 3.5" 2.88 megabyte floppy drives are now correctly identified in the
    System Information and Format windows (Ondrej Zary)

[-] Some drive types were reported incorrectly by the DPMI version under pure
    DOS (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] Selecting Abort in the System Error window caused a crash in DPMI version
    under pure DOS (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] Long file names could not be used on Novell NetWare remote drives
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Clear Read-Only from CD-ROM option did not work in DPMI version under pure
    DOS (Max Vasilyev)

[-] The CopyLimit parameter from [Kernel] section of DN.INI was used not only
    in Windows, but in DOS too. This did not match the documented behavior
    (Max Vasilyev)

[-] The SmartWindowsBoxClose DN.INI parameter ([Kernel] section) almost never
    worked. Now it is fixed both for real-mode and DPMI versions. The only
    limitation remaining is that you should start DN.COM from Windows
    directly, not, for example, from a batch file, in order for the close
    button to work (Vitaly Astaforkin)

    >>> DN.INI parameters, setup and options <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] New DN.INI parameter: UseF3InViewer = long ([Interface] section). Similar
    to the existing UseEnterInViewer parameter ([Interface] section). When set
    to 0, pressing F3 in viewer does nothing; when set to 1, F3 closes the
    viewer window; and the value of 2 means that F3 should cycle through
    text, hexadecimal and dump view modes (Alexey Feldgendler)

[+] New DN.INI parameter: PoorFrames = bool ([Interface] section). Value of 1
    means that the character encoding being used does not contain all the
    pseudographic characters. In this case DN uses a reduced set of characters
    for rendering various boxes (Pawel Ziemian)

[*] Made the memory allocation for DN.INI parameters more efficient
    (Pawel Ziemian)

[*] When reading DN.INI file, syntax errors are reported along with the
    corresponding line numbers (Pawel Ziemian)

[*] Optimized writing of DN.INI (Pawel Ziemian)

[*] The colour of scrollbars in the database viewer is now customizeable
    (Max Morozov)

[*] Updated some default values: enabled Advanced copy, turned on Check free
    space for all drives, added some new column presets (Max Vasilyev)

[-] The Ending string in the Printer setup was ignored (Anton Fedorov)

    >>> File manager <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] When HandleChDirCommand=1 is set in the [Kernel] section of DN.INI, one
    can browse remote drives without mapping them to drive letters. To change
    to a shared network resource, just enter "cd \\server_name\resource_name"
    (Anton Fedorov)

[*] Directories are now compared using long file names (Max Morozov)

[*] When copying files, the system cache is flushed each time after writing
    the whole RAM load, in case when more than one megabyte was transferred.
    The tests show that it really speeds up copying (Stanislav Olkhovik)

[*] Disabled syntax highlighting for Quick View panels, as handling it
    properly would require introducing too many color customzation entries
    (Max Morozov)

[-] File search could find particular files not matching the wildcard pattern
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Renaming a file with Alt-F6 to one of the description file names like
    files.bbs caused its content to be damaged (Anton Fedorov)

[-] After renaming a file, a stray space appeared between its name and
    description in the descriptions file (Max Vasilyev)

[-] The last description from a descriptions file could be deleted incorrectly
    (Max Vasilyev)

[-] File sizes were not shown according to the country setup
    (Marcin Gryszkalis)

[-] Fixed display of sizes for very large files, including compressed sizes
    in archives (Marcin Gryszkalis, Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> Editor and viewer <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Files viewed with external facilities are now correctly recorded into the
    view history unless they reside in a temporary storage like files
    extracted from archives for viewing (Alexey Feldgendler)

[*] Optimized the Open file at cursor Editor feature by speed, not changing
    the logic (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Improved the Open file at cursor Editor feature: fixed the logic for
    extracting the file name from the current line, added correct handling
    of absolute pathnames, made cosmetic changes to the related user
    interface. Also fixed the newly created DN.SPF not becoming visible until
    refresh (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] Fixed a possible crash when opening an Editor window (Anton Fedorov)

[-] When opening a file in Editor, stray empty lines could appear
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] After viewing a file with an internal viewer (Alt-F3) it was impossible to
    view it with an external tool (F3) because it was recorded in the view
    history. Now F3 always selects the viewer that matches the file's
    extension, be that viewer internal or external. Selecting an entry from
    the view history still activates the viewer last used for the file
    (Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> User Add-on Package <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Added more examples and fixed some old ones in the DN.EXT, DN.HGL, DN.XRN
    configuration files from the User Add-on Package (Andrzej Kowalczyk)

    >>> Archivers <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[-] Fixed reading of WinRAR 2.80 beta 1 and later archives (Max Vasilyev)

    >>> System Information <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Added Windows ME (Millennium Edition) detection (Ondrej Zary)

[*] OS/2 Warp Server for e-Business version is shown in System Information
    (Max Vasilyev)

[-] Too many LPT ports was sometimes reported by the System Information
    (Anton Fedorov)

    >>> Miscellanous <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] DDI disk images can be unpacked (Max Vasilyev)

[*] Added arcctg function to Calculator as a synonym to arccotan
    (Michael Mercuryev)

[-] Fixed sqrt function in Calculator (Michael Mercuryev)

[-] Fixed the VGA palette not being properly initialized on startup
    (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] After running an external program, the VGA palette was reset to the
    default values (Marcin Gryszkalis)

[-] When in 132-conumn extended video mode, the initial state of the video
    mode selection menu did not reflect the current mode (Pawel Ziemian)

[-] Pressing PgUp while moving a window would cause it to jump off the screen
    (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] A help window called from a menu could be obscured by it
    (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] Characters with decimal code 255 used in the Help window could cause
    unwanted visual effects sometimes and were replaced with spaces
    (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[-] Multiple cosmetic fixes to the Russian user interface (Michael Mercuryev)

[-] Fixed a number of other bugs, minor and not...


   Version 1.51.11
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    >>> Compatibility issues <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[-] DN caused a conflict with LFN00X long file name services for Windows NT
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] DN caused a conflict with QEMM memory manager (Jiri Travnicek)

    >>> DN.INI parameters, setup and options <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] New DN.INI parameter: RecombineLongLines = bool ([Editor] section). As
    before, lines longer than 255 characters are cut into several lines when
    loading a file in any case. But now, when the new option is enabled, each
    line that is exactly 255 or 254 characters long is recombined with the
    next line when saving the file or writing the selected block to a file.
    This allows limited editing of files with lines longer than 255
    characters: all usual editing can be done on the last line segment, and
    only character replacement, but not insertion or deletion, is possible on
    the prior segments (in order not to change their length). To indicate the
    special status of these lines, they are highlit when hit by the cursor
    (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[*] Added 1ST, ANI, BAS, CC, CHR, CUR, CXX, DB, DIB, HPP, HXX, JAV, JAVA, JS,
    MAK, ME, MOV and WP extensions to the corresponding highlight group
    defaults (Alexey Feldgendler)

[*] Tweaked the default palette setting for the Terminal window frame
    (Alexey Nemytov)

[-] Some accented Cyryllic characters used in Russia and Ukraine were not
    subject to case conversion by default (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] A value of zero accidentally specified for the screensaver delay could
    make DN lock up in an endless loop (Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> File manager <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] On 104-key extended keyboards, the Menu key now opens the menu associated
    with the extension of the current file. This allows to free Alt-Enter for
    Windows needs (Michael Averbukh)

[-] Drive type captions in the drive selection menu were always in English
    (Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> Editor and viewer <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Added support for text files with LFCR-style line breaks (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Fixed detection of line break type (Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> User Add-on Package <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Added many new xlat tables to the User Add-on Package
    (Pavel Protasov, Andrzej Kowalczyk)

[*] Added more examples and fixed some old ones in the DN.EXT, DN.HGL, DN.MNU,
    DN.SPF configuration files from the User Add-on Package
    (Andrzej Kowalczyk, Alexey Feldgendler)

[*] The User Add-on Package now contains DN.INI with English and Russian
    comments describing each parameter (Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> Miscellanous <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Splitting the DNUtil unit into two parts and placing the one that is not
    required to be constantly present into the overlay helped to free up some
    conventional memory without suffering in performance (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Cosmetic fixes of many dialog windows in Russian resources (Pavel Borodin)

[-] Fixed a number of other bugs, minor and not...


   Version 1.51.10
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    >>> Compatibility issues <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[-] DN was unable to utilize the long file name services under Windows NT and
    dosemu (Anton Fedorov)

[-] DN was extremely unstable under Windows NT. In particular, it was unable
    to delete a directory; some output strings were erratically duplicated
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] DN did not work in real mode under MS-DOS (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Access to Novell Netware shared volumes was impossible or erratic
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] The DPMI version failed to handle file system related errors, such as
    a physical read or write error (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Fixed handling of file system related errors under OS/2 (Max Vasilyev)

[-] Altered the file management mechanism firmly, eliminating a bunch of
    problems, both effective and potential (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Fixed a bug related to changing work directory under MS-DOS (Anton Fedorov)

[*] Reverted to quick sort in real mode. This increased both performance and
    reliability of the real mode version (Anton Fedorov)

    >>> DN.INI parameters, setup and options <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] New DN.INI parameter: UseEnterInViewer = long ([Interface] section). When
    set to 0, pressing Enter in viewer does nothing; when set to 1, Enter
    closes the viewer window; and the value of 2 means that Enter should
    cycle through text, hexadecimal and dump view modes (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[*] The information set shown in the drive selection menu is now configurable
    not only by modifying the DriveInfoType DN.INI parameter directly, but
    using the new options added to the Interface setup dialog window
    (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[-] The DN.INI [Kernel] DoVesaTest parameter did not work (Pawel Ziemian)

[*] Reorganized the editor and viewer options and placed them in separate
    dialog windows (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Cosmetic changes to the Screensaver setup dialog window (Alexey Nemytov)

[-] Cosmetic changes to the column deafults dialog windows (Mariusz Borkowski)

[-] The AutoWrap and WrapJustify keywords in DN.HGL were erratically swapped
    by their meanings (Pawel Ziemian, Marcin Gryszkalis)

[-] If there were spaces between the last extension in the list and the
    opening bracket in DN.EXT, the last extension was never matched
    (Alexey Feldgendler)

[-] Replaced the incorrect filter U[1-9][1-9] for highlight group 2 with
    U[0-9][1-9] (Alexey Feldgendler)

    >>> File manager <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[*] Optimized memory utilization by TEMP, Branch and Find panels
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Restarting DN with a TEMP or Find panel open caused a crash
    (Anton Fedorov)

[-] After cancelling the Branch panel building, it is now shown empty without
    any weird effects (Anton Fedorov)

[*] Description files with descriptions linked to long file names are now
    correctly read and updated. However, new descriptions are still linked to
    short names (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Fixed updation of the description file with file operations: now the
    descriptions are correctly updated and deleted when copying, moving and
    deleting files even if there are several descriptions for a particular
    file (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

[-] After automatically updating the description file like descript.ion,
    its attributes were reset (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Fixed deletion of descriptions spanning several lines (Max Vasilyev)

[-] Sometimes an attempt to ascend to the parent directory from a subdirectory
    or an archive could bring up the root directory (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Browsing archives with subdirectories caused a memory leak (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Fixed extraction from archives without extensions (Anton Fedorov)

[-] Fixed launching of files without extensions (Anton Fedorov)

[-] External programs launched from the user menu did not receive lists of
    files selected in either panel (Anton Fedorov)

    integer part and a new string flag (STRINGFLAGS keyword) (value 128) that
    restricts control character sequences highlighting to caret-letter pairs
    with a non-alphabetic character being the next (this solves some problems

[*] Tweaked window sizing logic. Alt-Z now toggles between the maximum (with
    fully visible borders) and the prior size, and Ctrl-Alt-Z switches the
    extra-large (with invisible side borders) and the prior size. This is
    true for the editor, viewer and terminal windows. The file manager window
    was also subject to modification: Ctrl-Alt-Z now only enlarges the current
    panel to the size of the whole file manager window, not zooming the latter
    to the screen extent and leaving this task up to Alt-Z. This influenced a
    change of DN.DSK desktop file format (Anton Fedorov)

[!] Totally replaced the INI engine. In particular, all the user comments are
    left intact when automatically updating (Anton Fedorov)

[+] New DN.INI parameter: SmartWindowsBoxClose = bool ([Kernel] section).
    When enabled, an attempt to close Windows 9x/2000 console box is
    equivalent to pressing Alt-X in DN (Jaroslaw Osadtchiy)

    ([Interface] section). The first parameter affects viewer windows, the
    second one affects editor windows. When set to 1, instead of opening a new
    separate window for a file already opened, a prompt to activate the
    existing window is issued. When set to 2, the existing windows are

    >>> Long File Names <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[!] Long file names supported everywhere. Unfortunately, there are limitations
    not depending on us, that make it impossible to open or delete files whose
    full pathname is longer than 255 characters

[+] A new system setup parameter available for each particular drive:
    Don't use long file names. It prevents DN from using long names even if
    the operation system reports them as being available

[-] Fixed a bug related to the bi-coloured strings rendering, which sometimes
    worked incorrectly for strings containing the tilde character

[+] It is now possible to create up to 10 panel view presets, switchable
    with Ctrl-1 ... Ctrl-0

[+] Added new macro sequences like ! and $. Everywhere # means active panel,
    & means passive. The macros also can be used in the User Menu item names.
    #  &  - current file's long name up to the last dot, not including that
            dot, without quotes
    .# .& - current file's long extension (the text after the last dot or
            empty string if there are no dots), without quotes
    #\ &\ - long path to the current file
    #/ &/ - long path to the current file (without the trailing \)
    #: &: - same as !: and $:
    ## && - respectively # and & characters
    !%? $%? #%? &%? - a special replacement, where the ? may be:
     a - file attributes: RHSVDA, minus signs in place of absent attributes
     c - compressed size or the real size outside an archive
     d - last modification date according to the current date format
     r - compression ratio (with the percent sign), "100%" outside an archive
     s - file size (uncompressed size in archives), an empty string for
         directories
     t - last modification time according to the current time format
     z - the first line of file description, without heading and trailing
         spaces, or an empty string when descriptions display is disabled

    >>> DN.INI parameters, setup and options <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

[+] A new DN.INI parameter: UseLFN = bool ([Kernel] section), on by default,
    enables the global long file name support

[*] The CopyLimit8M parameter has been removed from the [Kernel] section of
    DN.INI

     3: 1 and 2 together

[+] The "cd path" and D: commands are now handled by DN itself, without
    starting a command shell. This can be disabled by setting the
    HandleChDirCommand = bool DN.INI parameter ([Kernel] section) to zero

[+] Added auto detecting of codepage for a file newly opened for editing (not
    present in the editing history). For auto detecting, set the
    DefCodePage = str DN.INI parameter ([Editor] section) to AUTO. For WIN or
    KOI to be considered actual the text must contain small, capital letters
    and wovels; for each 500..999 small letters there must be a capital letter
    but not more than one capital for each 5..9 small letters; plus a wovel
    for each 5..9 small letters

[+] Removed HideLocalCurDir, HideNetworkCurDir parameters from DN.INI, instead

[+] Ctrl-RShift-Tilde dumps the current internal state to DN.ERR

[-] Removed directory descriptions were not deleted from FILES.BBS

[+] When renaming with Alt-F6, the descriptions file is now currectly updated

[+] The descriptions are now copied or not depending on the descriptions
    copying setting. The descriptions display option affects only the default
    value for this setting

[+] The description continuation line can now start with a tab, not only with
    a space

[+] Overwriting a file overwrites its description now

[+] With the new Kill descriptions container option in the File Manager setup,
    a description file that becomes empty is automaticaly removed

[+] AVT files support added. Creating, removing, renaming and moving
    directories is supported. When reading or writing files in AVT is
    attempted, appropriate batch files for AVCOMSTR are created.

[*] Long file names in AVT are handled correctly

[*] Character colouring information is now saved along with the screen dump in
    DN.ERR

[*] The Anonymous string used in Tetris, as well as the On and Off strings

   Version 1.51.04
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

[+] The file list creation function has now the option to add specific strings
    or file contents to the top and/or bottom of the list being created. The
    Insert text mode inserts the text line specified before the beginning or
    after the end of the files list. Insert files mode inserts a sequence of
    text files whose names are specified and delimited with ";", with a
    non-fatal warning message for each nonexistent file. In the Auto mode,
    when at least one of the files listed and delimited with ";" exists,
    the function works like in Insert files mode except that no warnings for
    non-present files are generated. Otherwise, the Auto mode works like the
    Insert text mode

[-] Fixed an old minor bug related to FTN adress handling when creating file
    lists

[*] File lists visited with the Read file list command are now recorded in the
    directory history. File lists, as opposed to directories, are shown
    without the trailing "\" in the history list

[+] Added "logarithm of y by the base x" function to the Calculator:
    log(x,y) (x>0, y>0, x<>1)

[*] The Calculator now correctly raises to negative powers: x^y (y<0)

[-] Incorrect argument values for arcsin(x), arccos(x), sec(x), cosec(x) and
    fact(x) now result in an error message rather than a zero value

[-] Up arrow in the Calculator caused previous command selection from the
    command line. This was an erratic behavior

[-] The clipboard.dn file was created on exit even if SaveClipboardOnExit = 0

[*] On external program invokal, an "@echo off" line was put at the end of the
    temporaty bat or cmd file. Now it is put at the beginning as well

[+] The User Menu parameters (lines starting with "<=") can now contain
    macros, so an expression like <=!:\! would be handled as expected.
    To specify "!" and "$" characters literally, type them twice, as usually

[*] Some amount of lower memory was freed by placing the Novell unit in the
    overlay module

[-] Creating a file with Shift-F4 in a directory with System, Hidden or, in
    some cases, other attributes, resulted in an "Invalid file name" error
    message

[+] Added support for ACE, AIN and ZXZIP archivers

[*] The Current archiver command brought to the top of Archivers menu

[*] A submenu that does not fit the screen, for instance the Archivers menu,
    is now scrolled

[*] The first submenu of the main menu (the System Menu) is now shown as the
    "." (#4) because of the previously used character (#240) sometimes
    appearing as a cyryllic letter. There is an option to specify any other
    character instead

[-] "UU-encode" and "Directory tree" commands in the Russian resources were
    both bound to Ctrl-F7 hot key

[-] The drive selection menu from Ctrl-F3 and in some other cases was shown
    with a very strange shadow

[-] The current directory name containing a tilde character was shown
    incorrectly in the drive selection menu as well as long file names with
    tilde characters were displayed in weird colours

[*] Brought back the colour customization options for the Trash can

[*] Cosmetic fixes to the Russian resources (some strings were in English,
    one message was broken, highlighted letters caused a conflict in the
    editor menu, the menu items order was different from the English
    resources, highlighted letters caused a conflict in the Archive dialog) as
    well as the English resources (highlighted letters caused a conflict in
    the Archive dialog)

[+] The prompt to copy next file when there is insufficient space for the
    current one now has an All button, which causes Yes to be implied for all
    such prompts for the duration of the current copy operation

[*] When Check free space option is on, the destination drive is checked to
    have enough free space to accomodate all the files, and if it has not,
    a prompt to attempt the copy operation is displayed

[-] Deleting a file's description from descript.ion, files.bbs sometimes left
    a blank line in the description file

[-] The Horizontal scroll bar in the editor window was sometimes shown
    incorrectly

[-] When the editor window became inactive and its border turned single-lined,
    the left border remained double-lined

[+] Replace All operation in the editor is now undone and redone as a single
    action

[-] Ctrl-J in the editor with Russian resources opened the Terminal window
    instead of executing macros

[+] A new hotkey Alt-" (Alt-quote) quickly toggles the hidden files display
    mode

[-] Some keys pressed with Shift while quick searching could cause DN to
    change to the upper directory

[+] Alt-Z zooms the current panel to the full screen or restores its prior
    state

[-] Fixed a bug related to Alt-Z handling in the viewer

[+] The editor window can now be horizontally zoomed just like the viewer by
    pressing Alt-Z

[-] F3 opened all files as plain text, ignoring DBF and WKZ extensions

[-] The Word wrap options worked only when the Line wrap was on

[-] In the hex viewer for short files it was possible to use Ctrl-PgDown only
    after a Ctrl-PgUp

[+] When reading new or updated DN.INI, the parameters are saved in the binary
    form to dn.cfg. If DN.INI was not touched since the last start, it shall
    not be read over again

[*] All DN.INI parameters related to the Clock were moved to the new [Clock]
    section

[*] The SmallClock parameter was renamed to ShowSeconds and its meaning was
    inverted

[*] There is a space and not comma between the day-of-week name and the date
    shown by the clock while Ctrl is held

[+] When ShowSeconds = 0, the colon between hours and minutes flashes every
    second

[*] Fixed clock positioning logic. When they are in the right half of the
    screen, they are right-aligned to a fixed horizontal position,
    and when they are in the left half, they are left-aligned. Also fixed the
    intermediate state between ShowSeconds = 0 and ShowSeconds = 1

[*] File attributes window now shows four digits for the creation date

[+] The new Change language command in the System menu (Alt-F12 hot key)
    changes the current interface language 'on the fly'. It causes the
    ActiveLanguage DN.INI parameter to change its value and DN automatically
    restarts (the user is prompted to save all the files being edited). Some
    windows still fail to change its language automatically (Editor, CD
    Player, some other) and they are to be closed and opened again

[*] The resource files for each language have the new names <language>.lng and
    <language>.dlg, and the help file names are <language>.hlp. There is no
    need to rename these files anymore. It is strongly recommended to delete
    the old dn*.lng, dn*.dlg and dn*.hlp files, because their presence can
    invalidate the language switching logic

[+] Since the old resource files can cause the quick language switching
    feature to malfunction, DN automatically checks for files names dn.dlg,
    dneng.dlg, dnrus.dlg, dn.lng, dneng.lng, dnrus.lng, dn.hlp, dneng.hlp,
    dnrus.hlp on the first start. If any are found, DN shows the list of old
    files and offers to automatically delete them. If the user refuses, the
    prompt will never appear again

[*] The "Please report to RIT" string in the fatal error message is replaced
    by "Report to RU.SHELL.DN"

[*] Reorganized the authors information shown with Alt-I in the About box;
    updated the "About Navigator and its authors" help topic

[+] New DN.INI parameter type: char, which means any single character

[+] New DN.INI parameters:

    [Interface] section:

    SystemMenuChar = long
    - The character to be used for the System Menu. Specified as the decimal
    ASCII code

    [Clock] section:

    ShowCentury = bool
    - show four digits for the year while Ctrl is held

    ShowDayOfWeek = bool
    - show day of week while Ctrl is held

    DaysOfWeek = str
    - specifies names for days of week shown while Ctrl is held, different
    from the language default. When the value is 14 or 21 characters long,
    it is considered a sequence of seven three- or four-letter names
    respectively. The names are listed without spaces, starting from Sunday,
    for instance, SunMonTueWedThuFriSat. If the parameter has some other
    arbitrary length, is left blank or omitted, the language default is used

    [Editor] section:

    AutoBracketPairs = str
    - specifies any number of bracked pairs for the AutoBrackets feature. This
    value has no effect on the bracket search feature. The default is ()[]{}<>

    [SmartPad] section:

    LineChar = long
    - specifies the delimiter character to be used by SmartPad, as its decimal
    ASCII value. The pseudographic symbol used by default (-) is not desirable
    sometimes as it is not always correctly xlated

    [Game] new section:

    EnableGame = bool
    - set this to 0 to disable the built-in Tetris game

    [Language] new section:

    ActiveLanguage = str
    - A non-empty value is taken as the current language name. For example,
    ActiveLanguage=russian specifies that rusian.* resource files should be
    used. When this value is blank or omitted, the DNLNG environment variable
    is used. And when it is not present too, English is used

    HelpLanguageOverride = str
    - A non-empty value is considered the name of the help language. For
    example, HelpLanguageOverride=english forces usage of english.hlp. When
    this value is blank or omitted, the current interface language is used for
    help. If there is no help file for that language, English help is used

    ShowLanguageMenu = bool
    - A value of 1 means that the Change Language command (or Alt-F12) must
    show a menu listing all the languages available (the list of languages
    available is retrieved by scanning the DN startup and %DNDLG% directories
    for the resource files). This behavior is convenient when there are more
    than two languages installed. The value of 0 means that the command must
    automatically cycle to the next language available without showing a menu.
    0 is the default value


   Version 1.51.03

[+] Most of the units are moved to the overlay module, freeing a reasonable
    amount of lower memory

[*] Changed archiver setup defaults: ARJ, RAR and ChArc now save empty
    directories, correct switch set for maximum ARJ compression, removed

   Archives
    

[+] Size of '..' entry indicates the total amount of bytes of all files in
      current archive directory.

[*] Speed of reading archives improved.

[*] "Archiver Setup" dialog box (Options|Archives) now have displayed on its
      title the name of archiver currently being setting up.

[-] Fixed multiple-volumed ARJ archives reading.

[-] Fixed bug, which caused to determine wrongfully some files as ZOO or ARC
      archives.

[-] TDRs being extracted from archive for viewing no more stay in temp dir
      unerased.

[-] Options|Archives|Current archiver setup did not work properly - it
      was always tuning ARJ's settings, instead of "Archive Type" checkbox
      value of "Archive Files" dialog.

[-] RAR archives with dot-ended directory names (e.g. 'DN.\*.*', created
      using 'rar a -r dn dn.' command) are now viewing OK.

[-] Fixed "Swap when unpack/del/test" option in archiver setup. Now an
      archiver can be safely called without swapping DN (but in shorter
      memory space), and it significally improves the speed of archives
      processing.

[-] Turning on QuickView on open archive, and extracting a file, caused
      system crash, until desktop file was not erased from elsewhere.

[-] After extracting files from an open archive, or executing DOS commands,
      archive date ('..' entry) became undefined.

[-] Fixed percent calculation of large files in archive viewer.

   File Manager / Panels & Drives
    

[+] File|Unpack diskette images (Ctrl-I).

[+] "Do not kill descriptions" option added to Options|File Manager|Setup
      dialog box. It's now possible to control whenever the descritions
      should be preserved or removed from "descript.ion"-like files, when
      the descripted panel elements (files/directories) are removed by
      Erase/Move operation.

[+] Shift-Enter works on TEMP/List panels as well as on Find one.

[+] Seconds are now used in time comparing, also DN would not be confused
      with dates in 21'th sectury.

[+] Added Ctrl+R hotkey for re-reading tree.

[+] Del key for removing directories from Tree Panel (if appropriate option
    is set).

[*] It is now possible to call Directory Tree dialogue from Archive/Find/
    Branch/Temp file panel.

[*] File Manager: it's not possible to drop a directory to itself
    (if confirmation of mouse operations is switched off).

[*] Full-new 'Advanced Filter' (Alt-Del) logic.

[*] 'All drives' option of FileFind doesn't scan CD-Drives when not
      necessary as well as floppies.

[*] The dot does not appear after directory name when dropping it to cmdline
      by pressing Ctrl+[Shift]+Enter.

[*] Directories history can be obtained also from archive/find/temp drive
      panel.

[-] "Long Descriptons" in info panel disappeared after rereading (Ctrl-L) or
      changing "Columns Setup" (Alt-K) or "Description Mode" (Ctrl-K).

[-] Long descriptions are taken considerably to contens of Options|
      File Manager|Setup field, unlike 'files.bbs', hardcoded into previous
      versions.

[-] File manager did not operate huge numbers (>2^31) - now fixed due to
      large drives and archives/TDRs.

[-] Confirmation about launching AUTOEXEC.BAT no more asked from FileFind
      panel.

[-] DN could not operate with files, which has percent characters
      in its names - bug in earlier versions took these characters as
      string format specifiers.

[-] Fixed bug with reading empty root directories (e.g. formatted diskettes).
      In some cases it could corrupt the heap.

[-] Fixed bugs, caused system crashes and memory losses of 'Change Directory'
      Tree Dialog (Alt-T).

[-] Bug with dragging files with tilda characters in the name.

[-] Quick file rename with Alt-F6 doesn't lose file descriptions anymore
    (if the description was visible during renaming).

[-] Weird bug with cursor appearing in both panels after a disk error.

[-] Directories descriptions are no longer forgotten in the source directory
    during copy/rename operation.

[-] Fixed bug with Copy / "Refresh old files".

[-] Was unable to call Copy/Move and some other dialogs just after making list
    file.

   Miscellaneous
    

[+] Long time operations (loading files for edit, scanning drive trees,
      directory branching and sizing) can be cancelled by pressing ESC key.

[+] 'Multilanguage' critical errors.

[+] Options|Configuration|Startup|TimeSlicing Options
      [ ] DOS Idle (Int28)       periodically returns to DOS remainings of
           time intervals by calling Int28. This option alone is compatible
           with timeslicing mechanism of previous versions of DN.
      [ ] Sleep when inactive    when it is nothing to do, and no key
           pressed during several seconds, DN falls asleep.

[+] Options|Configuration|System Setup|Options|Flush disk buffers - if set on,
      DN forces File System Manager to flush immediately all write-back
      buffers after copying/erasing files

[+] Options|Configuration|System Setup|Options|Advanced copy
      [ ] When this options is set off, DN doesn't use EMS/XMS memory
            for filecopy buffering (the only conventional - all amount).
            It always copies only one file at a time - doesnt open
            a next file for reading before finished writing the current one.

[+] "Autodetermine" checkbox in Make List File dialog. If this option is set
      "on", every call to this dialog will make to determine the necessaty
      of paths (and set "Store path names in list files" automatically).
      Considered path names are useful only on Branch/Find/Temp-Drives,
      instead of a similar diskdrive panel. If "Autodetermine" option is set
      "off", the value of "Store path names" checkbox is not set
      automatically when calling dialog, but is preserving since last call.

[+] Screen Grabber now handles PgUp/PgDn and Home/End keys. Movement /
      resizement scale is also affected by Ctrl key.

[*] Semicolon is used as comment character in .MNU file.

[*] Improved speed of copying files.

[*] Empty field of "Temporary Directory" (Options|Configuration|System Setup)
      is treated as a value of %TEMP% (or %TMP%) environment variable.

[*] DN doesn't allocate more than 8 MB RAM for copy buffer to avoid
      unnecessary virtual memory swapping under multitasking envoronment.

[*] Branch, FileFind and Archive Viewers are now able to use
      EMS/XMS/SwapFiles, so their file storage possibities are expanded.

[*] Workaround for a bug of OS2 Warp 4 (Merlin) gammas - turn off
      Options|Configuration|System Setup|Options|Advanced copy - it will slow
      down copying and erasing, but will prevent system traps while erasing
      subdirectories.

[*] Windows 95 doesn't try to switch windowed session to full screen
      every time when DN examines VESA-BIOS presence on startup.

[*] Validating file creation date in 'Change File Attributes' dialog.

[*] When Screen Mode is changed, the clock is now properly positioned.

[*] Disk Formatter: Volume Label length is now correct (11 characters).

[*] Formatter and File Search windows are now shown in Window Manager.

[-] Fixed bugs with displaying copy gauges on large files (>~30Mb).

[-] Improved speed of erasing files. Earlier were doing it not so fast
      because of always trying to clear ReadOnly attribute before erasing
      file, even if this flag was absent.

[-] Value of "Options|Configuration|System Setup|Disable XMS/EMS usage"
      checkbox have been ignored in earlier versions - now fixed.

[-] Fixed calculator's "power" operation.

[-] Bugs with numbers beginning with '.' in Calculator and Spreadsheet.

[-] Fixed traps, appeared in calculator when character data was passed to
      function's argument, e.g. "EXP(A)".

[-] After modifying spreadsheets (WKZ) panel still left unrefreshed until
      pressing Ctrl-R.

[-] Now now DN asks to overwrite before copying (F5/F6) read-only files
      too - bug in earlier versions overwrote them without any confirmation,
      unlike normal files.

[-] Button width in message boxes now corresponds to caption width to prevent
      wrapping in international builds.

[-] Reanimator and Environment editor windows did not answered on Ctrl-F5
      keyboard combination (Size/Move Window command).

[-] "!\" and "!/" extension specifiers are now parsed normally, without
      a last character loss.

[-] Answering 'Cancel' on confirmation to save modified file before
      running external program or archive swapping, caused crash. Now fixed.

[-] When the amount of available extended/expanded memory was not
      enough to allocate overlays completly, DN halted with fatal error. Now
      in this case it leaves overlays on disk, but uses extended/expanded
      memory for other needs.

[-] Fixed problems with Advanced Format Dialog Box disposing.

[-] Terminal window resizing painted background with an invalid color.

[-] Redial timeout in autodialer is now working.

[-] Scrollback buffer overflow did not handled correctly and could
      hang the system.

[-] Printer Setup | Ending string value was ignored, it was always taken from
      Initial string.

[-] DN could not change the descriptions of TDR's with ReadOnly attribute,
      which is default for this type of files.

[-] Fixed problems, caused memory losses on TDR processing.

[-] Fixed displaying of tilda character in file name of copy dialog boxes.

   Navigator Link
    

[!] Navigator Link allows to access remote computer by a common file panel.
    The following features are implemented: Create/Remove directories,
    Copy, View and Erase files.

    Navigator Link uses its own communication protocol, a kind of Niagara(tm)
    block transfer protocol, developed by RIT.

    Advantages:

    - block streaming mode:
        Navigator Link works seamlessly in server/slave mode and doesn't take
        full CPU time during link session. Using of FOSSIL interface allows
        you to work via packet transport protocols (ipx/spx, tcp/ip) and other
        hardware (parallel port), if you have an appropriate FOSSIL driver.
        We left FOSSIL-driver writing for third-parties yet...
    - bi-directional mode and true full duplex:
        Both machines linked by DN have equal rights on each other's drives,
        and both can work with remote simultaneously.
    - advanced errror correction:
        Navigator Link uses double-level selective reject method, so it works
        even on high-noise lines.
    - real-time data compression:
        Link allows to transfer text files and directory data twice faster
        on the same line. The compression works more efficient than modems'
        internal compression methods.
