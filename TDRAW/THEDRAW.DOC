			       ORDERING INFORMATION


       Once a registered user of TheDraw, you are free to utilize the program
       as often as you wish.  Other than having a clear conscience, there are
       many advantages  to registered.   You receive in the mail a registered
       version of TheDraw with configurable editor commands, enhanced editing
       facilities,  context  sensitive  pop-up  help,  built in color shading
       screen,  and  macro  keys.    You  are  also  notified  via  mail when
       significant  enhancements  have  been  made.    Once  registered,  all
       upgrades are available for a $5 upgrade fee plus the  original TheDraw
       diskette (see below).

       To register, just send $20 plus $2 shipping/handling.  You receive the
       latest shareware and registered versions of TheDraw on disk along with
       documentation  (on  5.25"  diskette)  and  utilities.  If  you want to
       receive TheDraw on a 3.5 inch diskette, add an additional  $3 for each
       diskette ordered.

       If unsure, you can receive the latest shareware version of TheDraw for
       evaluation by sending $5 along with a note  indicating what  you would
       like (TheDraw in this case).

       Please use the following form or print the included file "MAILER" when
       placing an order.

       -----
       NON U.S. residents, draw  all checks  on U.S.  funds in  U.S. dollars.
       Also add  $5 for overseas handling.  Canadians can obtain postal money
       orders in U.S. denomination easily.


       UPGRADING TO LATEST VERSION OF THEDRAW

       Users who have registered (and received a diskette) may upgrade to the
       latest version  of TheDraw  by sending in their TheDraw ORIGINAL DISK,
       along with $5 plus $2 (shipping/handling).   Please  use the following
       order  form  when  upgrading.    If  there has been an address change,
       please indicate so on the order form.

       The original disk must be returned and contain  the registered version
       of  TheDraw.    The  disk  will  be reformatted and the current Master
       copied onto it.  Any  disk  in  poor  condition  will  be  replaced by
       TheSoft.   If the  serial number label is missing or the diskette does
       not contain the registered version  of  TheDraw,  the  update  will be
       refused and the diskette returned unchanged.

				   INTRODUCTION


       TheDraw  is  a  powerful  screen  image generator/editor for color and
       monochrome video users.  What  does  that  mean?    Literally, TheDraw
       makes designing and figuring out a video screen display childs play.

       Its basic  premise is  this: be easy to use.  The most novice computer
       user can make an Ansi text file screen  with TheDraw  in only minutes.
       From that  point on,  you can  explore and  use more of the horsepower
       available in TheDraw.

       Someone is probably saying "it edits screens...  big deal".  This type
       of person has never known the agony of creating a good looking menu or
       display for a program (assuming he/she programs), making a fancy batch
       file  intro  screen,  or  having  to  quickly  put together a computer
       presentation for the boss.

       The biggest problem most people face  is not  knowing what  looks good
       until we  see it.   Manual  editing can literally take hours, but with
       TheDraw you free form until everything is perfect.  Given  the picture
       in  mind,  it's  a  snap  to develop whatever is necessary or instruct
       TheDraw to create an  appropriate file.   Instead  of hours,  making a
       screen takes minutes.

       For  the  curious,  TheDraw  can  transform your masterpiece into data
       files with the following formats:

	     ANSI color text (useful in batch files, BBS's, etc...)
	     AVATAR color text (for BBS's needing better modem transfer)
	     PCBOARD BBS color text format
	     WILDCAT BBS color text format
	     ASCII text (compatible with word processors and text editors)
	     BINARY files (generic, useful in most everything)
	     BSAVE (for Basic)
	     COM files (actual separate programs executable directly
		by Dos - Great for batch files and presentations)
	     ASSEMBLER (source code for the die-hard)
	     TURBO PASCAL (directly compilable source code)
	     C (directly compilable source code)
	     OBJECT (Intel format compatible, suitable for linking.  Four
		varieties  available  for  generic  LARGE/SMALL  data models,
		TURBO PASCAL v4.0+, and QUICKBASIC v4.0+)
	     THEDRAW (custom format for fast loading and saving)
	     LIBRARY (custom format for storing many screens together)

       TheDraw was  long ago originally written as an improvement to a simple
       program named AnsiDraw written by Amrich  Enterprises.   Both programs
       provided similar  operation, with  TheDraw giving a much enhanced user
       interface.



       TheDraw v4.63    	   Introduction 		     1



       TheDraw is  now vastly  improved over  the abilities  of AnsiDraw, and
       most other  screen editors.   It  is compatible with systems that have
       270k of free memory available.  Monochrome and Color monitor users are
       supported,  and  a  special  keyboard  driver  allows  you to redefine
       keystrokes that do not operate properly or are used by  other programs
       (registered  version).    If  you  have  an  EGA or VGA video display,
       TheDraw permits editing on 43 or 50 line screens (respectfully).

       Normal color and multi-color ASCII FONTS  are fully  supported.  These
       are large  scale letters  and symbols  which span multiple lines.  The
       are perfect for making welcome messages or notes of importance.

       Another feature TheDraw fully supports is ANIMATION.   You can develop
       simple  presentations  quickly,  or  make  generic screens appear with
       pizzazz.  TheDraw can animate a  static image,  or animation sequences
       can  be  made  from  scratch;  thus  letting  you  fully  control  the
       appearance of your  work.    TheDraw  gives  you  a  maximum  of 16000
       separate  animation  "entries"  to  handle  the most complex job.  The
       final result can be saved to ANSI Animation, AVATAR Animation, TheDraw
       data  files,  or  TheDraw  library  files.    Please  refer to section
       entitled "The Animation System" for more information.

       To use TheDraw right  away, refer  to "Getting  Started with TheDraw".
       This section describes installation, and introduces using the program.

       Enjoy!

				    DEFINITIONS


       Throughout  this  documentation  you  may  run  across  the occasional
       enigmatic word  that  needs  explaining.      The  following  are some
       examples you might come across:

	     enigmatic      - mysterious or cryptic

	     [ENTER] or C/R - This represents the return key on the keyboard.
			      If you see this in the text, press the Enter
			      key; do not type the actual letters.

	     ESC or [ESC]   - Means to press the ESC key on the keyboard.

	     [letter]       - Means to  press the  actual key marked 'letter'
			      on your keyboard.   ie: [L]oad,  [L], or [L]eft
			      all mean press the letter 'L' key.

	     Alt-<letter>   - Alt- is always followed by another character.
	       or             Together, this symbol means to first press and
	     [ALT-<letter>]   hold  down  the  ALT  key  on the keyboard then
			      type the letter key following it.   ie: [ALT-A]
			      means hold ALT then press 'A'.

	     Ctrl-<letter>  - This is executed the same as the ALT key.
	     [CTRL-<letter>]  Press and hold down the CTRL then hit the
	       or             letter following.  ie:  CTRL-A and ^A mean the
	     ^<letter>        same thing - hold CTRL then press 'A'.

	     [LEFT] [RIGHT] - Means to press the corresponding keypad arrow
	     [UP] [DOWN]      key on your keyboard.  Similar to the [letter]
	     [TAB] etc...     example shown above.  ie: [UP] means to press
			      the up arrow key.

				SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS


       TheDraw requires an IBM PC/XT/AT or close compatible running MsDos 2.0
       or higher.   In  addition,  a  monochrome  adapter  or  color graphics
       display  adapter  (CGA,  EGA,  or  VGA)  plus monitor is needed to run
       properly.

       In a minimum configuration, 270 kilobytes of free memory are required.
       The  maximum  memory  usage  is  450k  of memory (8 page layers, 16000
       animation entries).   TheDraw  will  always  attempt  to  allocate all
       available memory up to the limits specified via the Setup utility.



       MULTITASKING ENVIRONMENTS
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       TheDraw  can  be  used  under  multitasking  or windowing environments
       provided the full video  screen  is  allocated  to  it.    The program
       directly  accesses  video  memory  and  the keyboard hardware for some
       functions.  TheDraw does not use any high  resolution graphics  in its
       operation.

       TheDraw  is  known  to  operate  under  Double  Dos  except  for minor
       problems.  Double Dos  disables  certain  keyboard  sequences (notably
       Ctrl-PrtSc).   For this  situation, people with the registered version
       of TheDraw can use the Setup utility to redefine the function of Ctrl-
       Prtsc to another key.

       TheDraw operates  under Microsoft Windows and Desqview provided memory
       and video requirements (as mentioned above) are taken  care of.   When
       Desqview  is  detected,  TheDraw  disables its normal video checks (to
       prevent undesirable video mode switching).

       Windows 3.1 users running TheDraw may wish edit  any TheDraw  PIF file
       or  the  _DEFAULT.PIF  file.    Under the "advanced" PIF options, make
       certain that the "Retain Video Memory" option is  selected.  Otherwise
       unexpected display behavior may occur.

       Note:    It is easy to cause problems with some window environments if
		the user wishes.  Working  in  another  window  while TheDraw
		attempts  to  refresh  its  screen  may result in information
		being overwritten.

				  GETTING STARTED


       Setting up TheDraw to operate on your computer is fairly easy.  If you
       received TheDraw  on diskette,  we suggest  you backup the disk before
       proceeding.  It never hurts to play things safe.

       On registered diskettes obtained  from  TheSoft  a  batch  file called
       INSTALL.BAT is  included to  simplify installation.  The INSTALL batch
       file is not bundled with the shareware version of TheDraw.

       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       You will  want all  files frequently  used placed onto either a "work"
       diskette or your hard drive.  To reduce space requirements, most files
       are compacted.  You should use INSTALL to obtain them.

       First, insert the distribution diskette into drive A.  For floppy disk
       installation, type the command:

	  A:INSTALL FLOPPY

       For hard disk installation, type the command:

	  A:INSTALL HD

       After  either  command  press  [ENTER].    Simply  follow  the  online
       instructions presented.   Once  done, you  are all set to go.  INSTALL
       will explain about the README file and PRINTDOC  utility.   The README
       file contains  last-minute details about this release of TheDraw.  The
       PRINTDOC utility handles sending this documentation to your printer.

       If you have never used  TheDraw  before,  you  may  wish  to  read the
       section "Making  your First  TheDraw Screen"  below.  More experienced
       users might want to  configure items  and are  referred to  "The Setup
       Utility" section.


       CUSTOMIZING THEDRAW
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Many  facets  of  TheDraw  can be customized (colors, options, default
       preferences, etc...) using the external setup  utility.   Refer to the
       section called "The Setup Utility" for information on configuration.

       Some parameters are often changed when using TheDraw.  The more common
       of these can be updated within TheDraw.   See "Setup  Default Options"
       under the section "Pull-Down Menu System".

       STARTING THEDRAW
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       By this  point you must be eager to start playing with TheDraw; by all
       means do so.  If you're  using a  floppy disk  drive, place  your work
       diskette into Drive A and type the following command:

		THEDRAW       (for shareware version)
		THEDRAWR      (for registered version)

       Press [ENTER]  to run the program and display the title screen.  Tap a
       key, and then the edit screen appears.

       If you are using  a  hard  disk,  get  into  the  TheDraw subdirectory
       created by  the INSTALL  batch file  (the default is C:\THEDRAW).  Run
       TheDraw by typing:

		THEDRAW       (for shareware version)
		THEDRAWR      (for registered version)

       at the prompt.  Now everything is ready to make your first screen.

       Just a quick note regarding getting out of  TheDraw.   Should you need
       to leave  the program at any time, press [ALT-X] from the edit screen.
       TheDraw prompts to verify.  Type [Y]es or  press [ENTER]  to return to
       the dos prompt.


       CREATING YOUR FIRST SCREEN
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       After starting TheDraw, and pressing a key to get past the title, what
       appears is the edit screen.    The  screen  is  blank  except  for the
       status line.  The cursor is in the upper left corner.

       At  this  point,  type  in  your  name  and address as you might on an
       envelope.  Press [ENTER] after each line.  ie:

	     John Smith
	     123 ABC Street
	     Somewhere, CA 12345

       Use the [BACKSPACE] key to make deletions, and the arrow  keys to move
       around in the edit area.

       TheDraw contains  a wide  variety of commands designed to make editing
       easier.  To use some of  these,  try  performing  an  elementary task;
       centering your address on the screen.





       TheDraw v4.63    	  Getting Started       	     7



       There are  a number of ways to accomplish centering.  You could insert
       spaces onto each line (as if using a word processor), or insert entire
       blank  columns.    The  easiest  way though is using the provided text
       centering command.  ie:

	  o  First press [ESC] to  see the  pull-down menu  bar.   Select the
	     Global menu  using the  left/right arrow  keys then type [T] for
	     the "Text" command (a simpler way is the  shortcut; type [ALT-G]
	     from the edit screen for global screen functions, then [T]ext).

	  o  A prompt  appears above  the status  line.   Select the [C]enter
	     option.   Since  global  operations  affect  the  entire screen,
	     TheDraw centers -all- lines of your address horizontally.

	  o  Move the  cursor to  the top  line using [UP] arrow key.  Center
	     the address vertically  using  the  insert  line  command.   The
	     shortcut  key  is  [ALT-I].    The  command is also found in the
	     Screen pulldown menu.  Repeat four or five times to fully center
	     the image.

       The last  thing we  want to  do in  this first  screen is surround the
       address with a border outline.   TheDraw has  an easy  global function
       for doing this also:

	  o  Select "Text" from the Global pulldown menu (once again).

	  o  Choose the  [O]utline option.  TheDraw responds by drawing a box
	     around the edges of your address.

       There we have it, your first screen via TheDraw is complete!


       SAVING YOUR FIRST SCREEN:

       After all this work it makes sense to save your screen to disk.  Press
       [ESC] to  see the pull-down menu bar.  Select the Files menu using the
       left/right arrow keys then type [S]  for the  "Save" command (shortcut
       would be typing [ALT-S]).

       TheDraw knows of fourteen different ways to save a screen.  These vary
       from Ansi to a custom high speed library format.  For now  choose Ansi
       (with  defaults)  by  pressing  [ENTER]  four  times.  At the filename
       prompt appearing next type in:

	  ADDRESS.ANS

       Press [ENTER] to save.  Note how TheDraw reports the  number of output
       lines used.   Ansi files are compressed as much as possible, sometimes
       down to a single line.  Do not be surprised if this happens.

       VIEWING YOUR FIRST SCREEN:

       To see the results of the  above,  leave  TheDraw  by  typing [ALT-X].
       Answer [Y]es to the verify prompt.  From the dos prompt, enter:

	  TYPE ADDRESS.ANS

       Press [ENTER] to see the screen as it appeared within TheDraw.




       EGADS!  WHAT HAPPENED?

       It is  possible that  instead of  your address  appearing, instead you
       were faced with a large amount of gibberish.  Something like:

	  ^[[40m^[[2J^[[2;1H^[[3;1H^[[4;1H etc...

       This means the  Ansi  device  driver  is  missing.    The  Ansi driver
       translates special color and cursor control commands for the screen.

       TheDraw  creates  Ansi  compatible  files,  but  they  only  appear as
       intended when the device driver  is  present.    To  install  the Ansi
       driver, please refer to Appendix A ("Setting Up CONFIG.SYS").

       If you  already installed  the driver per Appendix A, something may be
       preventing  it  working  or  you  need   to  reinitialize/reboot  your
       computer.  Device drivers are only installed when the computer "boots"
       up.  Press [CTRL-ALT-DELETE] to reboot your system.




       EDITING YOUR FIRST SCREEN
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Time to try some more interesting things.  Restart TheDraw  and select
       "Load" from the Files pulldown menu.  A listing of all available files
       is displayed.  Type in:

	  ADDRESS   (TheDraw assumes the .ANS extension)

       Press [ENTER] to load  your  screen.    Everything  should  now appear
       exactly as  it did  before leaving  TheDraw previously.   To spruce up
       your address, let's try adding some color.

       CHANGING COLORS:

       There are many ways  to choose  colors with  TheDraw.   For now select
       "Fore/Back"  from  the  Colors  pulldown  menu  (shortcut [ALT-A]).  A
       screen showing two color  groups appears.   One  for foreground colors
       and the bottom smaller group for background colors.

       You choose  new colors  either by  using the  arrow keys or typing the
       number associated with a color.  Press [ENTER] once you decide.

       For example, to select a  Yellow  foreground  (color  14)  and  a Blue
       background (color 1):

		Please Select Foreground Color (0-31):  14  [ENTER]
		Please Select Background Color (0-7):   1   [ENTER]

       After pressing  [ENTER] for  the background  color, you  return to the
       edit screen.  Note the color example in the status line was updated.



       PAINTING THE SCREEN:

       To see the new color, put  the  cursor  inside  the  outline  box made
       earlier.  Now select "Paint/Fill" from the Options pulldown menu.

       Painting in  TheDraw refers  to the effect of pouring "paint" onto the
       screen.   The pouring  starts where  the cursor  is located.   You can
       paint  just   color  attributes,   just  character   symbols,  or  any
       combination.  We want only the address colors to change.  Thus:

	  o  Choose [A] for Attributes.   Notice  how painting  is blocked by
	     the lines of the address outline.

	  o  Use the  color change  command again,  this time selecting Light
	     Green on Black (foreground = 11, background = 0).

	  o  Once back at the edit screen, move the cursor out  away from the
	     outline box.

	  o  Select "Paint/Fill" once more, choosing the [B]oth option.

	  o  When TheDraw  prompts for  a fill  character; type  in a forward
	     slash "/" symbol.

       Your address is now an island in the  middle of  a green  field.  Save
       these changes as described previously this time using the filename:

	     ADDRESS2.ANS

       Press [ENTER] to save the screen to disk.

       MAKING YOUR SECOND THEDRAW SCREEN
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Now  for  a  little  more  pizazz.    For  this screen lets experiment
       duplicating the special effects  found  in  the  DEMO.TD  example file
       (more or  less).   To see  the sample  file beforehand, use the "Load"
       option from the Files pulldown.  Type in:

	     DEMO.TD

       Press [ENTER] to load  it.   Follow the  on screen  instructions for a
       quick introduction  to the  block and  sprite features.  These will be
       explained below as your own version of this example gets put together.

       To get rid of the DEMO.TD example, choose the "Clear Page" option from
       the Screen  pulldown (shortcut  [ALT-C]).   Answer [A]ll  to the first
       verify prompt, and [Y]es to the second verify.  This completely clears
       away everything.



       DRAWING LINES:

       Position the cursor at column 10, line 5.   Use  the arrow  keys until
       the status line coordinates read (10, 5).  In the first screen we used
       the Global Outline command to draw a box around your address.  TheDraw
       has another way of drawing lines too.

       From the  Toggles pulldown, choose "Draw Mode" to turn on line drawing
       mode (shortcut [ALT-M]).  Moving the  cursor now  draws a  line.  Also
       note the word "Draw" in the status line.

       Lets make a small box.  The arrows below indicate the cursor movements
       required to produce the box.   Note  the  special  attention  given to
       finishing off the last corner (step 5):

	          				     
	       컴컴커      컴컴커      컴컴커    ^냐컴컴     旼컴컴
		    퀆  	               ^               
				퀆   ^                         
			       켸v    읕컴컴     읕컴컴     읕컴컴
			             

	       Step 1      Step 2      Step 3      Step 4      Step 5


       Turn  off  line  drawing  using  the Toggles pulldown or press [ALT-M]
       again.  Following the  above guide,  we moved  horizontally six spaces
       and vertically  three lines to create the box.  The end result however
       is seven characters wide, and four lines deep.




       TheDraw v4.63    	  Getting Started       	    11




       Move the cursor to coordinates ( 6, 3)  and repeat  the box procedure.
       This time  move horizontally  14 spaces instead of 6, and vertically 7
       lines instead of just 3.  You end up with:

				  旼컴컴컴컴컴컴
				       	
				     旼컴컴   
				             
				             
				     읕컴컴   
				       	
				  읕컴컴컴컴컴컴

       These are the exact dimensions of the blue box in  the DEMO.TD example
       screen.  To colorize the double box, we'll use a block command.

       Note:    Please  refer  to  the  section  "SELECT  DRAW MODE" for more
       discussion on line drawing.


       MARKING A BLOCK:

       One of TheDraw's most useful features  is its  block editing facility.
       You can  carry out  a wide  variety of operations on specific parts of
       the screen.  Areas can be copied, moved, erased, deleted, filled, have
       text operations  performed, saved,  etc...  Several block commands are
       mirrors of the global screen functions you have already seen.

       To color the double  box,  let's  first  choose  some  new attributes.
       Press  [ALT-A]  and  pick  a  Yellow  foreground  (color 14) on a Blue
       background (color 1).

       Marking  means  highlighting  the  area  you   want  block  operations
       performed on.   Begin  marking a  block by pressing [ALT-B].  Position
       the cursor on the  upper-left corner  of the  large box  and press the
       [SPACE] bar.   Now  move the  cursor to  the lower-right corner of the
       large box and press [SPACE] again.  Notice how the existing colors are
       emphasized to clearly show the block mark.

	  Mouse Users:   Move  the  cursor  to  the upper-left corner.  Press
			 and hold down the LEFT mouse  button.   Now drag the
			 cursor  to  the  lower-right  corner and release the
			 left button.

       All block options are now displayed.  Select [F]ill, and the suboption
       [A]ttributes to colorize the double box to yellow on blue.  Other fill
       suboptions  affect  just  foreground  colors,  just  backgrounds, just
       characters (without affecting color), or both colors and characters.





       TheDraw v4.63    	  Getting Started       	    12




       There is  one more step before the double box is finished.  The inside
       region of the small box must be erased.   Let's  use another  block to
       accomplish this:

	  o  Position the  cursor to coordinates (11, 6).  This is the upper-
	     left corner of the inside region.

	  o  Mark a block covering all the inside region.

	  o  Lastly, select the block option [E]rase.

       There you have it; a replica of the blue box  in DEMO.TD!   Blocks are
       invaluable for making alterations of any sort.



       USING SPRITE MODE:

       While following  the DEMO.TD  example, you  saw the red box on page 2.
       Until now all our editing was done on page 1,  but TheDraw  can handle
       up to eight pages.  One possible use is block copying regions from one
       screen to another.    Normally  you  see  only  single  pages, totally
       separate from one another.

       Sometimes however, it is useful to see all the pages at once.  TheDraw
       calls this Sprite mode.   Pages  are treated  as glass  sheets stacked
       atop one  another.   You are positioned over the topmost "glass sheet"
       (page 1) looking down.  ie:

				       旼컴컴컴커
				      .      . 
				    .      .    Bottommost Page
				 旼컴컴컴커    8
			       旼좔컴컴커 냐컴컴
			     旼좔컴컴커     .
			              3 .
	       Topmost Page          2쳐
			            1쳐
			     읕컴컴컴켸

       The DEMO.TD example uses Sprite Editing.  The blue box  is on  page 1,
       but the  red box  is on page 2.  The blue box appears over the red one
       because of  the glass  sheet effect.   The  red box  would appear over
       anything on page 3, and so on...

       Now to try out Sprites in our screen.  We need a visible object on the
       second page.  The following draws a box for this purpose:

	  o  Change to page 2.  Do  this by  choosing "Select  Page" from the
	     Screen pulldown,  or typing  [ALT-E] (the  shortcut).  Press the
	     "2" key for the second page layer.


       TheDraw v4.63    	  Getting Started       	    13




	  o  Pick "Fore/Back" from the Colors pulldown  (shortcut is [ALT-A])
	     and  select  the  colors  of  Light  Red  on Red (foreground=12,
	     background=4).

	  o  Position the cursor in  the  upper-left  corner  of  the screen-
	     coordinates ( 1, 1).

	  o  Press [ALT-B],  and hit  the [SPACE]  bar.   Move to coordinates
	     (12, 6) then hit [SPACE] the second time.

	  o  Choose  the  [T]ext  option,  and  then   the  [B]ox  suboption.
	     TheDraw draws a red box on the screen.

	  o  Move  the  cursor  inside  the  box, and select "Paint" from the
	     Options pulldown menu.  Select the [B]oth option,  and press the
	     minus key "-" for a fill character.

       Page 2 now contains an object which will soon act as a sprite.  Switch
       back to page 1 by typing [ALT-E] and then the "1" key.

       If you loaded the  DEMO.TD  example  earlier,  TheDraw  is  already in
       sprite mode.  You can tell by how the page number appears.  ie:

		"Page:1"      Sprite mode is off
		"PAGE:1"      Sprite mode is on (word is capitalized)

       If sprite  mode is  off, type  [ALT-E] and choose the [T]oggle option.
       Once sprite mode is enabled the red box appears underneath  the double
       blue box.

       Sprite mode  editing is no different than normal editing.  Nothing you
       do on page 1 can affect  any other  page.   Try inserting  a few blank
       lines at  the top of the screen by typing [ALT-I].  Notice how the red
       box stays put while the blue box moves down.

       Assume you were drawing an elaborate screen.   Various parts  could be
       put on  different page layers.  Each part is thus protecting them from
       accidental change (since each page is independent).

       In animation mode sprites  make certain  special effects  very easy to
       produce.    Such  as  having  one  object  "slide" under another.  See
       SHUTTLE2.ANS for an example.    Animation  mode  is  introduced below.
       Please refer to "THE ANIMATION SYSTEM" for more information.

       You might  wish to  save this  screen now.   Type  [ALT-S], and select
       TheDraw's custom file format by typing [T].  This will save both pages
       edited.  Enter the filename:

	  BOXES 	(TheDraw assumes a .TD extension)

       Press [ENTER] to save to disk.

       ANIMATING YOUR SECOND THEDRAW SCREEN
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Possibly the  most intriguing  and confusing  facet of  TheDraw is its
       Animation mode.  The animation  system  allows  creating  screens with
       movement, adding excitement to your presentations.

       In  animation  mode,  TheDraw  remembers  the  exact  pattern in which
       something is entered.  To contrast, the static screens used  until now
       only store what was typed and where - like a word processor.

       When saving  a static screen, there is nothing about how it was drawn.
       The normal presumption is such screens  are saved  top to  bottom (how
       else would  you want  to?)    The  ADDRESS.ANS file  was saved in this
       manner.  Recall how it appeared when typed from the dos prompt.

       Animation mode goes one  step further  by also  remembering -when- you
       typed  something.    This  extension  permits you to control the exact
       sequence keystrokes appear.

       Instead of merely top-to-bottom, any display  order is  possible.  You
       can make screens display sideways or bottom-to-top if the urge hits.


       SELECTING A SCAN PATTERN:

       To ease the pain of making animated screens, TheDraw contains fourteen
       preprogrammed display patterns.  There are also two  variation toggles
       which boost the actual number of patterns to over 50.  See the section
       under "HOW TO ANIMATE SOMETHING" for a complete description.

       To convert your second  screen  into  an  animation  sequence,  do the
       following:

	  o  Select  "Animation  Mode"  from  the Toggles pulldown or use the
	     shortcut key [ALT-J].    A  list  of  the  preprogrammed display
	     patterns appears.

	  o  Choose the  [A]ngle pattern.   TheDraw  scans the static screens
	     on pages 1 and 2 into the animation sequence.

       That's it!  The word "PAGE" in the status line has changed  to "ANIM".
       Also, above the status line is an indicator similar to:

			      Used:00317  Free:15683

       The first  number lists  the number  of keystroke entries currently in
       the animation sequence.  The second is how  many additional keystrokes
       TheDraw can  store.   The maximum free space is 16000 entries, however
       that could vary depending on how much free memory is available.




       TheDraw v4.63    	  Getting Started       	    15




       VIEWING THE ANIMATION SEQUENCE:

       Let's see what the animation looks  like in  slow motion.   Select the
       "Screen Redraw" from the Animation pulldown (shortcut [ALT-Q]).

       TheDraw prompts  for a redraw speed, to control how fast the animation
       sequence appears.  A speed of 0 is maximum speed.  A  speed of  255 is
       very slow, about 5-10 keystrokes per second.

       Type in  the number 50 and press [ENTER].  You can now see exactly how
       the animation will appear once saved to disk.  Once  it completes, use
       the redraw command with some other speeds to get a better feel for it.

       Try changing  the animation  scan pattern.   Select "Rescan Animation"
       from the Animation pulldown (shortcut  is  [ALT-J],  [R]escan).   Pick
       some other animation pattern, then view them using Screen Redraw.



       SAVING ANIMATION:

       Saving animation  screens to disk is almost identical to saving normal
       static screens.  The only difference is in the available file formats.
       Only Ansi, Avatar, and TheDraw (TD) custom formats are possible.  Only
       these can save how the animation sequence was  created.   Note that TD
       formats also store page data.

       Ansi files can be typed from Dos.  These are very popular for bulletin
       board systems, sign on introductions, presentations, etc...   The only
       problem is  they cannot  store data  about individual pages and sprite
       mode.  Ansi files only save exactly what is "seen" on the  video.  Any
       keystrokes which are hidden underneath other objects are lost.

       Avatar  files  are  used  primarily  wit  bulletin boards systems, and
       provide faster data transmission than Ansi.  Like Ansi, the problem in
       dealing with sprite mode is shared; all page information is lost.

       TD files  are designed  for maximum speed.  It is usually best to keep
       one copy of an animation sequence  in  this  format.    The  TD format
       stores everything  - including  the sprite mode.  Most users save both
       TD and Ansi formats, since Ansi can be typed from the Dos prompt.  For
       now, lets save an Ansi file.

       Press [ALT-S],  and choose  [A]nsi.   Press [ENTER]  past the options.
       For a filename enter:

	  BOXES.ANS

       Press [ENTER] to save to disk.   Try  exiting to  Dos and  viewing the
       file from  there.  Just imagine how easy it would be to create a fancy
       signon screen for your computer.

       The animation system was only briefly  touched upon  here.   The are a
       large  number  of  other  features  available.    Almost  all commands
       available for static screens will work  with animation  mode.  Various
       commands respond  differently to  the animation  sequence though.  For
       complete coverage, please see refer to "THE ANIMATION SYSTEM".

       We have now run through the most important of TheDraw's many features.
       You  are  encouraged  to  explore  in  detail  the variety of commands
       available.  It is recommended to save your work periodically to create
       a log of your efforts.  In this way, as you develop new skills you can
       document them to avoid forgetting that one crucial step or  neat idea.

       Covered was keystroke entry, editing, changing colors, painting areas,
       drawing lines/boxes/outlines,  using  blocks,  sprite  mode, animation
       mode, animation  scan patterns,  and viewing animation sequences.  You
       should eventually read the "OPERATING THEDRAW"  section.   It explains
       the status  line, obtaining help, cursor control, using the mouse, and
       gives a summary of commands.

       Refer  to  "PULL-DOWN  MENU  SYSTEM"  for  brief  explanations  of all
       commands.    Detailed  descriptions  are  found in "THEDRAW COMMANDS".
       Those who program should see "TIPS  AND EXAMPLES  FOR PROGRAMMERS" for
       insight into using TheDraw saved files in your own work.





       THE EXAMPLE FILES
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       TheDraw comes  with four  demonstration files to help show some of its
       capabilities; SHUTTLE2.ANS, DEMO.TD, SHADING.TD, and EFFECTS.TD.

       SHUTTLE2.ANS is  a simple  animation example  which you  can view from
       the dos prompt by entering:

	  TYPE SHUTTLE2.ANS

       Press  [ENTER]  to  see  the  example  run through.  You must have the
       ANSI.SYS driver installed in your CONFIG.SYS  file for  this to appear
       properly.  See APPENDIX A for more details on the CONFIG.SYS file.  If
       you do not have ANSI.SYS, the THEPP utility provided with registration
       can be used alternatively (ie: THEPP SHUTTLE2.ANS [ENTER]).

       The  second  demo  file,  DEMO.TD,  demonstrates  the block and sprite
       editing features of TheDraw.  To  use  it,  run  TheDraw  as described
       above.   Next, press  ALT-L and  type DEMO.TD  [ENTER].   Instructions
       will appear on screen showing what to do next.





       TheDraw v4.63    	  Getting Started       	    17




       The  third  file,  SHADING.TD,  is  an  example  of  all  color  shade
       variations possible  within TheDraw.  Load as the previous example was
       (ie: ALT-L, then type SHADING.TD [ENTER]).   Three  pages are occupied
       by the example.  Select pages by pressing [ALT-E] followed by a number
       1, 2 or 3.    Each  page  uses  a  different  fill  character.   Those
       frustrated by  a seemingly  limited color  palette may be surprised at
       the wide variation actually possible.

       To duplicate a shading example, press [ALT-F6] to  select function key
       set 6.   Set  the colors as specified on the example by using [ALT-A].
       Foreground colors are vertical and background colors horizontal.   Now
       type [F1],  [F2], or  [F3] keys to see the shading result.  Registered
       users have a built in command to accomplish this -  just press [ALT-A]
       twice.

       The last  demo file,  EFFECTS.TD, shows  two easy  special effects you
       may like to use.  The  first  is  the  illusion  of  a  rotating color
       banner.  This is done with flashing foreground colors (16 to 31 in the
       color  select  screen).    Alternating  characters   have  alternating
       foreground/background attributes.  ie:

			        Character #1     Character #2
		   컴컴컴컴컴컴탠컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컵컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
		   Foreground:  Flashing Red     Flashing Gray
		   Background:  Gray   	  Red
		   컴컴컴컴컴컴좔컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컨컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

       Combine the  above color  scheme with the a block symbol from function
       key set #6.  Press key [F4]  with  attributes  in  #1  above.   Change
       attributes to  #2 and  press [F4] again.  The blocks will appear to be
       alternating.

       The restriction to this technique  is  the  flashing  foreground color
       must  match  an  available  background  color.   Since there are eight
       background colors,  the flashing  foreground colors  16 to  23 are the
       possible options.

       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       For convenience,  TheDraw allows  you to  specify a  filespec from Dos
       when first running the program.  ie:

				  THEDRAW DEMO.TD

       Only one file may be specified this way.   All  files are  loaded onto
       page  layer  one  (except  for  THEDRAW format files which may contain
       multiple layers).


       THE STATUS LINE
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       The status line of TheDraw shows  various information  about the state
       of the program.  Each structure in the status line is described below:

	  (xx,xx)        Displays the current cursor position.

	  Color 	 Indicates the  current drawing color.  This color is
			 used for any new characters placed onto the screen.

	  Text, 	 The word displayed indicates if TheDraw is in normal
	  Attr, or       text, color draw mode, or line draw mode.  In color
	  Draw  	 draw mode, moving the  cursor changes  characters to
			 the  current  colors.      In  Draw mode, moving the
			 cursor with the arrow keys draws a line in the moved
			 direction.

	  Ins   	 Appears  when  TheDraw  is in Insert keystroke mode.
			 When on, typing a character shifts everything to the
			 right to make room for the new character.

	  "c"   	 Appears when a symbol has been picked up for manual
			 painting (where 'c' is the character picked).

	  Page:x or      Indicates the current screen page edit layer.  In
	  Anim:x	 animation  mode  (see  The Animation System for more
			 details), the word Anim appears.   In addition, this
			 structure indicates  when TheDraw  is in sprite edit
			 mode (see ALT-E).   In  sprite  mode,  the structure
			 appears in capital letters.  ie: PAGE or ANIM.

	  Set:xx	 Number of  the current  function key  set.  This set
			 appears immediately after this indicator.


       Note: The symbol "x" or "xx" indicates a number of some value.

       HELP!
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       The shareware version of  TheDraw contains  four outline  help screens
       available from  command mode (no sub-functions being used) by pressing
       ALT-H.    These  outline  screens  display  brief  notes   about  most
       operations available in the program.

       The registered version of TheDraw supports context sensitive help.  In
       other words, pressing ALT-H anywhere  in  the  program  will  bring up
       specific information on that area of TheDraw.  This can be very useful
       during the learning stage or for rarely used functions.



       CURSOR CONTROL
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       The cursor may be moved by using the following keys:

		Key           Action
		컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
		Up Arrow      Up one line
		Down Arrow    Down one line
		Left Arrow    Left one position
		Right Arrow   Right one position
		Home          First column of current line
		End           Last column of current line
		PgUp          First line in current column
		PgDn          Last line in current column
		Ctrl-Home     First Character of current line
		Ctrl-End      Last Character of current line (plus 1)
		Ctrl-PgUp     Upper-left position of screen
		Ctrl-PgDn     Lower-right position of screen
		Tab           Next set Tab position (see Alt-T)
		Shift-Tab     Previous set Tab position (see Alt-T)
		Enter         First column of following line
		컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

       Naturally, if you attempt  to move  past the  screen border  no action
       will  be  taken.    If  no  tab position follows the current location,
       pressing [TAB] will return you to column one of the current line.

       MOUSE CONTROL
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       TheDraw fully supports the use  of  a  Microsoft  Mouse  or compatible
       device.    Pull  down  menus  and  other facilities are available (see
       section PULL DOWN MENU SYSTEM).   You may  use either  a two  or three
       button mouse with TheDraw.

       The mouse  operates differently depending on where you are in TheDraw.
       At command mode (no sub-functions in use) the mouse functions are:

	     MOVEMENT:        Moves cursor.
	     LEFT BUTTON:     Marks a block.
	     MIDDLE BUTTON:   Toggles line drawing mode
	     RIGHT BUTTON:    Activates pull down menu system.


       In any sub-function:

	     MOVEMENT:        Moves cursor/block/screen/etc...    If movement
			      is allowed, you can use the mouse.
	     LEFT BUTTON:     Equivalent to pressing [ENTER].
	     MIDDLE BUTTON:   Unused.
	     RIGHT BUTTON:    Displays a  small window  with all current menu
			      options.


       Someone comfortable with a mouse will  find TheDraw  easy to  get used
       to.   The mouse is usable everywhere in the program.  If no particular
       mouse indicator appears, the RIGHT mouse button will  generally pop up
       a window  with available  options.   Simply click  the RIGHT button on
       the wanted option to select it.

       Users without a mouse  will  find  TheDraw  operates  normally without
       change.

       Note: A  Microsoft  compatible  mouse  driver  (MSMOUSE.SYS or similar
	     program) must be  installed  into  your  CONFIG.SYS  file before
	     TheDraw  will   recognize  the  device.    See  APPENDIX  A  for
	     information  on  system  configuration.    Once  the  driver  is
	     installed, TheDraw auto-detects the mouse presence.

       The section THEDRAW KEYBOARD COMMANDS on the following  pages contains
       explanations for each of the above.


       TheDraw v4.63    	 Operating TheDraw      	    22




			       THE ANIMATION SYSTEM

       WHAT IS ANIMATION?
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       The animation  system can be the most intriguing but confusing portion
       of TheDraw  to grasp.   The  animation system  allows creating screens
       with movement, adding excitement to presentations.

       In animation  mode, TheDraw  remembers the exact way in which a screen
       is created.  In contrast, the static screens used until now only store
       where  something  is  typed.    When  saving a static screen, there is
       nothing about how it was drawn - they appear top-to-bottom when typed.

       Animation mode goes one  step further  by also  remembering -when- you
       typed  something.    This  extension  permits you to control the exact
       sequence keystrokes appear.    Instead  of  merely  top-to-bottom, any
       display  order  is  possible.    You  can  easily make screens display
       sideways or bottom-to-top as required.

       With the animation sequence you put characters in anywhere and  in any
       order  you  want.    The  sequence  is repeated in the same order when
       played back.  For  example typing  the numbers  0 through  9 backwards
       along the screen.  ie:

			 旼컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
			       			 
			       			 
			       9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0      
			       			 
			  ( <--- typed this direction ) 
			 읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

       Upon replay,  the "0"  would appear  first, followed  by the "1", "2",
       etc...  Exactly as was typed.  Note  in this  example movement  of the
       cursor was not stored, although it could be.  Storing cursor movements
       will be discussed later.

       Animation can be saved in three different formats: ANSI (.ANS), AVATAR
       (.AVT) and  THEDRAW (.TD).   A sequence saved in Ansi can be displayed
       using the Dos TYPE command on  any computer  with the  ANSI.SYS driver
       installed (see  Appendix A on how to install it).  Ansi files are also
       used widely on bulletin board systems.   Avatar  is similarly  used on
       bulletin boards.   TheDraw  is not needed to display Ansi/Avatar files
       once created.

       TheDraw's custom file format  (TD)  is  used  for  quickly  saving and
       loading animation sequences to disk.  The Presentation Program (THEPP)
       can display an animation sequence saved in TheDraw format.

       For an example of Ansi Animation,  enter "TYPE  SHUTTLE2.ANS" from the
       Dos prompt (once the ANSI.SYS driver is installed).

       ANIMATION BASICS
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       TheDraw never  physically "moves"  an object when animating something.
       This is an illusion; created by careful placement of characters (which
       as you  remember can  be put  anywhere we want).  The "animation" of a
       display is done manually; moving objects step by step.

       The illusion of movement is simple to describe:

	  o  Draw an object.
	  o  Erase it.
	  o  Redraw object shifted over slightly.
	  o  Repeat (over and over)

       If done properly, the object  appears  to  move.    Nothing  is really
       "moving" per say, but we are simulating it.

       For an  example, imagine  an asterisk in the center of the screen.  We
       wish to have this asterisk move to the  right.   To do  this, first we
       put a space over the existing asterisk (thus erasing it), then display
       a new asterisk over to the right (redrawing it).   Repeating this will
       "animate" the asterisk, since it appears to move.  ie:

	  旼쩡쩡쩡쩡쩡쩡
	     *          Asterisk as it initially was drawn.
	  읕좔좔좔좔좔좔
	  旼쩡쩡쩡쩡쩡쩡
	     _          Asterisk has been erased
	  읕좔좔좔좔좔좔
	  旼쩡쩡쩡쩡쩡쩡
	     _*         A new asterisk has been drawn shifted over.
	  읕좔좔좔좔좔좔
	  旼쩡쩡쩡쩡쩡쩡
	     __*        Above steps repeated.
	  읕좔좔좔좔좔좔

       Do the  above process  quickly, and the user effectively sees movement
       because the eye smoothly connects the  old asterisk  position with the
       new one for us.


       A SIMPLE EXAMPLE
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       The easiest  animation example  under TheDraw to play with is a snake.
       Our snake, we'll call him Slither from now on, will  be a  simple life
       form who grows each time he is moved.  In effect, Slither's tail never
       shifts because he grows so rapidly.   To  create this  particular life
       form, enter  animation mode  by pressing  [ALT-J], then  [T]op.  Next,
       turn on line drawing with [ALT-M] ("Draw" appears on the status line).




       TheDraw v4.63           The Animation System     	    24



       To give arise to Slither, move the cursor with the  arrow keys.   Keep
       moving in  the same  direction and low and behold there he is.  Change
       direction, and move for a while.   Make Slither do as many twists and
       turns as you like, since he really enjoys a good run (or crawl?)

       Now for the moment of truth.  Make Slither repeat what he  just did by
       using animation  redraw (ALT-Q).  Enter a delay of about 100, then sit
       back and watch Slither perform.

       Notice just how little  effort it  takes to  produce simple animation.
       Even  this  uncomplicated  approach  will  add that extra pizzazz to a
       presentation.  Possibilities include  drawing charts,  graphs, outline
       figures,  backdrops,  etc...    Your  imagination is the only limiting
       factor.

       The next section describes how to move objects (such as the asterisk
       example shown previously) with TheDraw.


       MAKING A BLOCK MOVE:

       The asterisk  example  showed  the  classic  method  for  moving small
       objects.  ie: draw, erase, draw, repeat...   However, the medium under
       which our  animation special  effects operate  is quite  limited.  The
       illusion of  movement is lost with large objects because too much time
       is spent erasing and redrawing them.  A better way is needed.

       For larger objects, we can use  the block  copy facility.   First draw
       the object, and decide what direction things will move.

       The trick  follows:   Mark a  block over  the object,  ADDING an extra
       blank line/column on the side -opposite- to the direction of movement.


	    block outline --> 旼컴컴컴
			       OBJECT --> movement to be in this direction
			      읕컴컴컴
			       ^컴컴 note extra blank line


       TheDraw v4.63           The Animation System     	    25




       The complicated bit of actually "animating" is:

	  o  From the block options menu, choose block copy.

	  o  Move the block once in the direction of movement and [S]tamp it.

	  o  Move it again, and [S]tamp.  Repeat as many times as desired.

	  o  For the last shift, press [ENTER] instead of stamping.

       That's it!  Now try redrawing with [ALT-Q].  You have created a moving
       object.   This new  approach is  similar to  the asterisk example, but
       note we do not explicitly erase the entire object before  shifting and
       redrawing.  A good improvement making each shift almost twice as fast!

       Objects are  generally larger  than the distance moved between shifts.
       Afterwards they use most of the same space as before.   Thus,  why you
       may ask,  bother erasing  if an area is immediately overwritten again?
       We can avoid wasting time and things will go faster.

			     ^ ^ ^
			     읕좔좔 old portion of object,
				     "erased" by blank line

       The extra blank  line  erases  what  needs  erasing,  and  the redrawn
       object overwrites  the rest.  By using more than one blank column/line
       (and stepping more than once between stamps), the  movement appears to
       go faster still.

       Notice that  block copy  was used, not block move.  In animation mode,
       the block move relocates animation  entries  in  the  block.   Copying
       leaves the original in place, and -overwrites- it with the moved copy.
       Just like the asterisk example, we didn't move it, we overwrote it.

       Block move physically moves  the object  to the  first stamp location.
       If you  redraw the  animation sequence,  you would find no "movement".
       The object is drawn only once, where it was moved over to (at least on
       the first stamp).  Additional stamps would behave as expected.

       EASY ANIMATION
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Rather than start an entire animation screen from scratch, many people
       find it easier to take an existing static screen then  -add- animation
       to it.     TheDraw provides  several different patterns for converting
       static screens into animation sequences.   The patterns  specify how a
       screen is converted, one keystroke at a time.


       ANIMATION SCAN PATTERNS:

       TheDraw comes  with fourteen built in scan patterns.  In addition, the
       way the scan patterns work can  be adjusted  via two  pattern toggles.
       Use of the toggles yields over 50 possible combinations!  The starting
       scan patterns are:

	 TOP          Starts at upper-left corner and goes across screen.
	 LEFT         Starts at upper-left corner and goes down screen.
	 CLOCK        Clockwise arm rotates around center of screen.
	 CIRCLES      Growing circles starting from center of screen.
	 CHECKERBOARD Alternating "checkerboard" squares from top of screen.
	 ANGLE        Diagonal from upper-left corner scans across screen.
	 GATE         Opposite lines from each side of screen left/right.
	 PYRAMID      Pyramid shape from bottom center growing upwards.
	 SQUARES      Squares starting from screen border growing inward.
	 SCRAMBLE     Randomly scans entire screen
	 DOOR         Scans top/bottom, on both sides of screen at once.
	 DIAMOND      Growing diamond starting from center of screen.
	 WIGGLE       Starts at upper-left alternating left and right.
	 WIGGLEOUT    Starts in center of screen with  wiggle operation going
		      both up and down at once.

       The two toggles which alter the above are:

	 REVERSE      Completely reverses  a given  pattern.  First keystroke
		      scanned becomes  the last,  the second  becomes next to
		      last, and so on.

	 FLIP         Exchanges the vertical coordinates in a scan.  Assume a
		      25 line edit buffer.  Any  scan location  on line  1 is
		      changed to line 25 and visa versa.

       You  select  the  toggles  before  a  scan  pattern.  When a toggle is
       active, its corresponding indicator appears on the screen.

       As mentioned above, many people want to take a static  screen, display
       it normally,  then add  animation.   The option to use in that case is
       the Top scanner.  Scanning from the Top yields a sequence which cannot
       told apart from a static display; but animation can now be added.

       RECORDING CURSOR MOVEMENTS:

       Occasionally the  ability to record actual cursor movements is useful.
       They could  be used  as short  pauses, or  a distraction  to the user.
       Instead of  putting keystrokes everywhere, just having the cursor jump
       about could be enough.  TheDraw can record such cursor movements.

       Toggle on/off cursor movement recording by  picking "Movement Storage"
       from the  Animation pulldown.  The shortcut command is typing [ALT-J],
       then [M]ovement.  Moving the cursor in any way adds new entries to the
       animation sequence.

       Using cursor movements, you could have the cursor go around in circles
       giving the user time to reading something.  The only definitive reason
       to use this feature is personal taste.



       EDITING AND DELETING ANIMATION ENTRIES
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Editing an animation sequence is a bit more complicated than fixing up
       a static screen.  If you make a  mistake, you  must be  -VERY- careful
       about using the [DELETE] and [BACKSPACE] keys.  The problem is both of
       the above keys remove all animation entries from the cursor position.

       Take the case where you type 'A', 'B' and 'V' all in the same location
       (say the  upper-left corner).   Meaning the 'V' to be a 'C', you press
       [BACKSPACE].  Unfortunately, this  command removes  all three letters,
       not  just  the  'V'.    The  delete/backspace  keys  can be especially
       disruptive to large animation sequences.

       TheDraw offers a special command to  avoid this  problem.   Choose the
       "Erase Character"  command from the Animation menu (shortcut [ALT-Z]).
       This shaves off just the animation  entry which  is visible.   The 'V'
       in this case.  You then proceed by typing the 'C' as intended.

       An alternative  technique is the animation "Change Character" command.
       Choose it from the  Animation  pulldown  (shortcut  [ALT-W]),  and the
       existing  keystroke  under  the  cursor beings to flicker.  Meanwhile,
       TheDraw prompts for the  new character.   Now  you just  enter the new
       symbol (a 'C') and are done.

       For more  complicated situations,  you could place some items on lower
       pages and use sprite mode.  This physically separates animated objects
       and protects  them from accidental damage.  However, it only works for
       moving objects under  those  on  the  current  page.    The registered
       version offers a better solution called animation edit limiting.

       CHANGING YOUR ANIMATION SCAN PATTERN:

       If you  decide to change the scan pattern you selected earlier, choose
       "Rescan Animation" from the Animation pulldown, or [ALT-J], [R]escan.

       Warning: All animation on the current page will be replaced.

       TheDraw deletes all animation  from the  current page,  scans with the
       new pattern,  appending the  new results onto the end of the animation
       sequence.  Any customized changes you might have added are lost.  Only
       the current page is affected.  All other page layers stay intact.



       ADVANCED ANIMATION EDITING
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       There are several more complex functions which enhance your ability to
       create unique special effects.  These  include the  animation limiting
       offered in  the registered  version, include  files, and making custom
       control code sequences.  The  latter  especially  useful  with certain
       bulletin board systems.


       EDITING PARTIAL ANIMATION SEQUENCES:

       The shareware version of TheDraw only allows you to work on the end of
       an animation sequence.  You can  add  or  remove  things  easily.   To
       update something at the beginning of a sequence is more awkward.

       The registered  version helps significantly by adding a feature called
       animation limiting.  Now you can change the point where editing occurs
       on the  animation sequence.   Instead  of just  the end, edit anywhere
       from the first to last keystroke entry.  A powerful improvement.


	  ANIMATION LIMITING:

	  Animation limiting  changes the  focal point  of TheDraw.   You can
	  insert/delete any keystroke anywhere in the animation sequence.

	  Choose "Limiting"  from the Animation pulldown to activate it.  Now
	  use the  arrow keys,  [PGUP], [PGDN],  [HOME] or  [END] to position
	  yourself inside  the sequence.   Once  you find  the correct place,
	  press [ENTER].

	  Picking a edit focal point is that easy.  When  in the  middle of a
	  sequence, everything  after the  focal point is temporarily hidden.
	  Now you can make any updates with no extra fuss.

	  Once done, you should probably return to the  end of  the animation
	  sequence.  Choose "Limiting" again.  Press [END] to reset the focal
	  point, then [ENTER].


       TheDraw v4.63           The Animation System     	    29




	  ANIMATION MARKERS:

	  Markers provide a convenient way of jump around within an animation
	  sequence.   Assume you constantly switch between the point where an
	  object is drawn and the sequence  end.   By setting  a marker after
	  the  object  appears  you  can  switch quickly, instead of manually
	  positioning the focal point every time.

	  To set a marker, first position  the  focal  point.    Next, choose
	  "Marker" from  the Animation  pulldown.   TheDraw displays a window
	  listing all current markers.  If  none  are  defined,  the  list is
	  empty.  Type [S]et and enter a description of the marker.  ie:

		1:  Object has been drawn

	  Press [ENTER]  to save the new marker.  From now on, to position to
	  this marker,  select "Limiting"  from the  Animation pulldown, then
	  [K] for markers.  Pick marker [1] and you are done!


       INCLUDE FILES:

       TheDraw permits "including" the contents of other files in the current
       animation sequence.  Typically this will be an  "Ansi Music" sequence,
       a frequently  used image,  complex BBS  control codes, merging several
       Ansi/Avatar screens together, etc...

       The include files  are  only  used  when  TheDraw  actually  saves the
       current animation sequence.  At that point, the include file is copied
       into the new output file TheDraw is making.

       Include files are ignored by the animation screen redraw command.   If
       you want  to see  what everything  might look  like, a  view option is
       available in the animation  include window.   Refer  to the "ANIMATION
       OPTIONS" section for more information.


       MAKING CUSTOM USER CONTROL SEQUENCES:

       You can insert your own short control code sequences directly into any
       Ansi/Avatar file TheDraw generates.  This  is very  useful for special
       BBS control  codes (ie:  for user  names and such), or inserting extra
       Ansi codes into the animation.  You might  force the  screen to clear,
       or cause the display to scroll - functions not supported by TheDraw.
       User Sequences  are only  referred to  when TheDraw  saves a file, and
       are not used when redrawing (see  ALT-Q).    Refer  to  the "ANIMATION
       OPTIONS" section for a complete description of user sequences.

       TRICKS AND TECHNIQUES
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Once  the  above  mentioned  animation  skills  are down, certain easy
       special effects will help  liven up  a display.   Care  given to color
       selection, shading,  and use  of shadowing to furnish depth or a three
       dimensional feel can perform wonders.   Animation is  also improved on
       occasion by pausing the display slightly.

       Ideally you  will find  the "tricks" are not really tricks at all, but
       rather easy skills to master.  A little  practice will  put you firmly
       on the right track.


       USE OF COLORS:

       Good  color  selection  is  as  important as the display content being
       viewed.  Colors should  be high  contrast, but  not so  as to distract
       the viewer.   For  example, Yellow  on Cyan  go well together, however
       Magenta on Green do  not.   Extensive theory  exists to  predict which
       color to  use with  what, but for our purposes some experimenting will
       suffice.   Look for  combinations which  are easy  to read  and do not
       strain the eyes.  Observing other peoples work is a good teacher.

       Background  colors  should  be  used to your advantage, not detriment.
       For example, look closely at the TheDraw title screen and note how the
       layering was  achieved.   Half block  characters (such as "" and "")
       are used extensively with the solid  portion one  color and  the blank
       region another.

       Lastly, flashing  colors in combination with good background selection
       is an excellent visual  device.    For  example,  select  flashing red
       (color 20)  on a  gray background  (color 7).   Put  a block character
       ("").  Now select flashing gray (color 23) on a red background (color
       4).   Put another  block character next to the first.  What you see is
       the block colors alternating between red and gray, each block opposite
       of one another.  Repeating this pattern produces a moving effect.  See
       the demo file EFFECTS.TD for a working example.


       SHADING:

       Shading and shadowing discussed below are both used for adding texture
       and three dimensional quality to a display.  Shading is the process of
       gradually changing visual intensity.   This  can be  done using bright
       colors then  more subdued  colors, or  using different characters with
       different density such as "갚꾼".

       For successful shading, one must be aware of  how things  truly appear
       in nature.   Carefully  examine a  round pen  sitting on a table.  The
       color is not uniform, but rather bright in the middle  then apparently
       darker towards the edges.  The same holds true for any curve.


       TheDraw v4.63           The Animation System     	    31



       Example of how color changes on a curved object:

				  brightest here

			   darker  複賽賽賽賽複  darker
				 輻            霜
				       	 
		 darkest here  		    darkest here
			      死		  死


				    같같같같같
				  같굇께께께굇같
				 갚굉께栢栢께껑굅
				갚굉께栢栢栢께껑굅
				갚굉께栢栢栢께껑굅
				 갚굉께栢栢께껑굅
				  같굇께께께굇같
				    같같같같같


       The  above  character  shading  example  shows one way of matching the
       curvature example.  You can obtain more gradations  by using  high and
       low intensity color in combination.  For a case in point, coloring the
       following symbols as indicated yields eight shades of blue:

					light
					blue
					  
			       light 컫커憫왯쩡 blue
				cyan  昉굉굅굅

       The file EFFECTS.TD demonstrates  the above  example.   Every possible
       shading combination  is shown  in SHADING.TD,  using three pages.  The
       registered version has a built in screen modeled  after the SHADING.TD
       screen.


       SHADOWING:

       This  effect  gives  an  object  the  illusion of a third dimension by
       throwing  a  "shadow"  onto  something.    Many  popular  programs use
       shadowing to highlight menu or other box structures.  Shadows are made
       by duplicating an object shifted down and over slightly, in a darkened
       color.  ie:
			       栢栢栢栢栢栢栢栢栢栢
			       栢栢栢栢栢栢栢栢栢栢
			       栢栢栢栢栢栢栢栢栢栢
			       栢栢栢栢栢栢栢栢栢栢
				같같같같같같같같같같

       The most effective shadow colors are the light and dark grays.

       PAUSING:

       TheDraw  directly  supports  two  types  of animation pause: timed and
       keyboard.  Unfortunately, there is no  way  to  wait  for  a keystroke
       response in  an Ansi  file.   The keyboard  option is operable only if
       TheDraw or THEPP (see following section in documentation)  is used for
       displaying the  animation.   Timed pauses can be approximated however,
       by inserting redundant codes into the Ansi file.

       One application  might be  slowing down  steps of  an animated object.
       The  object  is  shifted  once,  then  a short pause occurs before the
       object is shifted again.   The  relative speed  difference (ie: object
       redrawn faster  than shifting  occurs) could help smooth the animation
       in some situations.

       Another application of course, is  placing  a  delay  after  a message
       appears.    Whisking  something  away too quickly might frustrate some
       users.  For instance, the SHUTTLE2.ANS example uses two delays.



       PITFALLS AND LIMITATIONS
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       You will discover a few limitations of Ansi animation as you progress.
       Large objects tend to "ripple" as they move.  ie:

			      旼컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
			       		     <-- ripple effect
			       		   
			       		   
			       		   
			     읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

       Large object also use a significant portion of the available animation
       space.  You will be amazed how quickly  even 16000  entries disappear.
       Objects up  to 30 character by 10 lines (30x10) in size generally work
       with minimal difficulty.  Faster computers can get  away with slightly
       larger blocks.

       Since only  one character  point can  change at any given time, having

			 TIPS AND EXAMPLES FOR PROGRAMMERS


       This section is for individuals writing programs who are interested in
       using TheDraw.  Effort was put  forth  to  make  TheDraw  a convenient
       programmers  utility.    The  various  sections  which follow describe
       example code for each of the  various languages  TheDraw is compatible
       with.   The routines are tested and can be quite useful for those just
       getting started.  If you have  additional ideas  for this  section, we
       highly encourage you to send them in!


       PROGRAMMING IN ASSEMBLER:

       Assembly programmers  will find  ASM formatted  files in standard data
       byte format, using the DB operator.  Asm files can  have varying sizes
       depending  upon  the  save  mode  used  (Ascii/Normal/Crunched).   The
       dimensions and  length of  the save  are displayed  at the  top of all
       assembler dumps.   If  you crunched  the screen,  you will have to use
       the uncrunch  routine  provided  in  ASM  source  code (UNCRUNCH.ASM).
       Values required in the CPU registers are documented in the file.

       Ascii formatted files must be read as bytes and saved on the screen as
       words.  This can  be  achieved  using  LODSB  and  STOSW instructions.
       LODSB loads  into AL  the character.   You  store into  AH the desired
       screen color attributes.   STOSW then  writes the  two bytes  onto the
       screen.   An alternate method would be to use the Bios or Dos, however
       these methods are considerably slower.

       A normal 4000 byte dump (80x25 screen) is  the easiest  to display via
       the REP MOVSW instruction.  To display the image, point the ES:DI pair
       to B800:0000 (for color  screens; B000:0000  monochrome) and  DS:SI to
       the screen  in your  program.   Also load  CX with the number of video
       words to display (2000 - A total of 4000 bytes).  ie:

		MOV      AX,0B800h
		MOV      ES,AX
		MOV      DI,0
		MOV      SI,offset ImageData
		MOV      CX,2000
		CLD     			  ;Make MOVSW go forward.
		REP   MOVSW

       If writing to a EGA screen (80x43), CX would need 3440.   If to  a VGA
       screen (80x50), CX would need 4000.

       As shown  above, the  ImageData is  written directly  onto the screen.
       This will cause hashing or "snow" on some  color video  displays.  You
       may want  to move  only one  video word  at a  time, pausing until the
       video hardware is in horizontal or  vertical  retrace.    This  can be
       accomplished with the following routine.


       TheDraw v4.63           Pull Down Menu System    	    34




       Example:

	  MOV   AX,0B800h
	  MOV   ES,AX
	  MOV   DI,0
	  MOV   SI,offset ImageData
	  MOV   CX,2000
	  CLD

	  MOV   DX,03DAh	   ;Save i/o address of CGA status register

       LOOPA:
	  LODSW 		   ;Read data to be written
	  MOV   BX,AX   	   ;Save for later.

	  MOV   AH,9    	   ;Test mask for Vertical/Horizontal retrace

	  IN    AL,DX   	   ;Read the status register
	  TEST  AL,8    	   ;See if in vertical retrace?
	  JNZ   WRITE_IT	   ;Jump if so.  No need to wait here.

       LOOPB:
	  IN    AL,DX   	   ;Read the status register
	  RCR   AL,1    	   ;Test bit1.  Make sure we are not in the
	  JC    LOOPB   	   ;middle of a horizontal retrace.

       LOOPC:
	  IN    AL,DX   	   ;Read the status register
	  TEST  AL,AH   	   ;Wait until in either vertical or
	  JZ    LOOPC   	   ;horizontal retrace.

       WRITE_IT:
	  MOV   AX,BX   	   ;Retrieve the character we loaded before.
	  STOSW 		   ;Save it.

	  LOOP  LOOPA


       The above  is a  fairly complex mess, but will reliably place a screen
       image snow free onto the display.   This  routine is  not needed  on a
       monochrome video since such hardware does not suffer from snow.

       Notice the  entry code  is identical  to the  previous simple example.
       The REP MOVSW is has been replaced with extensive checks  on the video
       hardware however.

       PROGRAMMING IN PASCAL:

       Pascal programmers  have equal  ease with  displaying screens.  Images
       can be flashed to the screen using the Turbo Pascal  "MOVE" procedure.
       A pascal NORMAL save can be displayed with the following program:

	 {$I image.pas}
	 type ScreenType = array [0..3999] of Byte;
	 var Screen : ScreenType absolute $B800:0000;

	 begin
	   Move (ImageData,Screen,4000);
	 end.

       The  above  defines  a  variable  at the absolute address of the video
       memory.  The importance of defining such an array will  become obvious
       below.   IMAGEDATA is assumed to be the name of the pascal image dump,
       but is easily altered  when saving  the file  from TheDraw.   The MOVE
       procedure puts  ImageData onto  the screen.   Please note this is only
       for a full screen.    To  display  a  screen  block  is  slightly more
       difficult.  Our program now becomes:

	 {$I image.pas}
	 type ScreenType = array [0..3999] of Byte;
	 var Screen : ScreenType absolute $B800:0000;
	     X,Offset : Integer;
	 begin
	   Offset := ???;  {Replace ??? with offset to display block}

	   for X := 0 to IMAGEDATA_DEPTH-1 do
	     Move (ImageData[1+X*IMAGEDATA_WIDTH*2],
		   Screen[X*160+Offset],IMAGEDATA_WIDTH*2);
	 end.

       The  constants  IMAGEDATA_DEPTH  and IMAGEDATA_WIDTH specify the block
       dimensions of IMAGEDATA, and  are generated  by TheDraw automatically.
       If  you  change  the  name  identifier,  the width and depth names are
       updated also.  The depth is the number of vertical lines in the block.
       Width is  the number  of character  across the  block.   OFFSET is the
       video address you want the block to appear at.  It is computed with:

			     (column*2)+(row*160)-162

				Column varies 1..80
				 Row varies 1..25

       Notice in this example we are using a  loop and  moving one  line at a
       time.   Lines from  ImageData are  placed on the video at OFFSET.  The
       address in ImageData is advanced to the location  of the  next line in
       each loop.   The  video address advances 160 characters each time (the
       byte width of the video display).

       Turbo Pascal v3.0 users also have another interesting option.  You can
       include a .BIN file into a turbo program and then display it using the
       above techniques.

       The file actually becomes part of your compiled pascal program.   Once
       your program is compiled, you no longer need to have the DEMO.BIN file
       present.

	 procedure DummyProc; external 'DEMO.BIN';

	 type ScreenType = array [0..3999] of Byte;
	 var Screen : ScreenType absolute $B800:0000;
	     X,Depth,Width,Offset : Integer;
	     ImageDataPtr : ^ScreenType;
	 begin
	   Depth := ???;      {Replace ???'s with actual block dimensions}
	   Width := ???;      {as specified by TheDraw after .BIN save.}
	   Offset := ???;     {Replace ??? with position to display block}

	   ImageDataPtr := Addr(DummyProc);

	   for X := 0 to Depth-1 do
	     Move (ImageDataPtr^[1+X*Width*2],Screen[X*160+Offset],Width*2);
	 end.

       In the above program, we create  a pointer  (IMAGEDATAPTR) pointing at
       the address  of DUMMYPROC.   The rest of the program is similar to the
       previous example, except all  occurrences  of  IMAGEDATA  are replaced
       with  IMAGEDATAPTR^.    Also,  since  the  block  dimensions  are  not
       available, you must specify them.

       The up arrow symbol at the end is  very important.   If  you don't use
       it, Turbo  will copy  the -value- of your pointer to the screen.  This
       will generally appear as  garbage.   It can  be fun  playing with this
       concept, you simply must be careful with the pointers.

       Pascal ASCII  saves are  used similar to strings.  Since the ImageData
       arrays created do not have color  attributes, we  cannot directly move
       them to  the video.  The following shows two techniques for displaying
       these images.

	 --- Pascal ASCII Save Example 1 ---

	 {$I image.pas}
	 var X:Integer;
	 begin
	   ClrScr;
	   for X := 1 to IMAGEDATA_LENGTH do Write (ImageData[X]);
	 end.





       TheDraw v4.63           Pull Down Menu System    	    37



	 --- Pascal ASCII Save Example 2 ---

	 {$I image.pas}
	 type ScreenType = array [0..3999] of Byte;
	 var Screen : ScreenType absolute $B800:0000;
	     X:Integer;
	 begin
	   ClrScr;
	   for X := 1 to IMAGEDATA_LENGTH do
	     Screen[X*2-2] := ImageData[X];
	 end.

       The first example is easiest to  understand.    All  we  are  doing is
       displaying each  character in IMAGEDATA on the screen using the pascal
       WRITE function.  This works because the IMAGEDATA block (in this case)
       is 80  characters wide, so there is no need for a WRITELN.  The cursor
       will automatically be bumped down to the next  line.  IMAGEDATA_LENGTH
       is another constant automatically generated by TheDraw.

       The second  example is  similar to  the first, but directly stuffs the
       characters onto the screen.    This  will  be  faster  than  the first
       method.  Notice the Screen[X*2-2].  The multiplication is done because
       each character occupies two bytes of  video memory.   Since  the first
       video address is 0, we add -2 to the offset to keep things aligned.

       To  use  pascal  images  CRUNCHED  by  TheDraw  requires  use  of  the
       UNCRUNCH.PAS file  included  with  the  package.    The  file contains
       details and instruction on using crunched images.


       TURBO PASCAL v4.0 through v5.5:

       The above  examples will all work for Turbo Pascal v4.0 to v5.5 users,
       with exception to the external .BIN file example.  The newer compilers
       do not  support the  old format.  Instead you must use TheDraw's Turbo
       Pascal compatible Object (.OBJ) files.

       To use the object file do the following:

	 {$L DEMO.OBJ }
	 procedure ImageData; external;
	 procedure ImageData_Width; external;
	 procedure ImageData_Depth; external;
	 procedure ImageData_Length; external;

       The procedure name  (ImageData  here)  is  specified  when  making the
       object  file.    All  four  external  procedure  definitions  must  be
       specified (Turbo requires it).   Although  these are  "procedures" you
       MUST NOT  execute them.   They  only contain  image data which must be
       referred to via pointers.  The modified .BIN example follows:




       TheDraw v4.63           Pull Down Menu System    	    38



	 {$L DEMO.OBJ}
	 procedure ImageData; external;
	 procedure ImageData_Width; external;
	 procedure ImageData_Depth; external;
	 procedure ImageData_Length; external;

	 type ScreenType = array [0..3999] of Byte;
	 var Screen : ScreenType absolute $B800:0000;
	     X,Offset : Integer;
	     ImageDataPtr : ^ScreenType;
	     ImageDataWidthPtr : ^Integer;
	     ImageDataDepthPtr : ^Integer;
	     ImageDataLengthPtr : ^Integer;

	 begin
	   Offset := ???;       {Replace ??? with position to display block}

	   ImageDataPtr := @ImageData;
	   ImageDataWidthPtr := @ImageData_Width;
	   ImageDataDepthPtr := @ImageData_Depth;
	   ImageDataLengthPtr := @ImageData_Length;

	   for X := 0 to ImageDataDepthPtr^-1 do
	     Move (ImageDataPtr^[1+X*ImageDataWidthPtr^*2],
		   Screen[X*160+Offset],ImageDataWidthPtr^*2);
	 end.

       The above is for a generalized block of any dimension.   A  pointer to
       the IMAGEDATA_LENGTH  is initialized  but not  used.   It is there for
       example usage only.  The above program can be simplified  somewhat for
       an entire screen.  ie:

	 {$L DEMO.OBJ}
	 procedure ImageData; external; 	{All of these are needed,}
	 procedure ImageData_Width; external;   {otherwise Turbo v4.0-v5.5}
	 procedure ImageData_Depth; external;   {get upset.}
	 procedure ImageData_Length; external;

	 begin
	   Move (pointer(@ImageData)^,ptr($B800,0)^,4000);
	 end.

       Note the  usage of  typecasting to eliminate the pointer to ImageData.
       This cleans up the program  appearance  somewhat.    In  addition, the
       value of  4000 could  be replaced  with a pointer to IMAGEDATA_LENGTH.
       However, since this is an  entire  screen  why  bother  initializing a
       pointer.  A full 80 by 25 screen is always 4000 bytes in length.

       TURBO PASCAL VERSION 6.0 and 7.0:

       Everything  shown  thus  far  for  Turbo  Pascal  v4.0  to  v5.5 works
       perfectly well in TP 6.0  and  above.    However,  the  newer releases
       allows  a  more  relaxed  preinitialized  constant  definitions.   The
       previous examples can be shorten to:

	 {$L DEMO.OBJ}
	 procedure ImageData; external;
	 procedure ImageData_Width; external;
	 procedure ImageData_Depth; external;
	 procedure ImageData_Length; external;

	 type ScreenType = array [0..3999] of Byte;
	 var Screen : ScreenType absolute $B800:0000;
	     X,Offset : Integer;

	 const
	   ImageDataPtr : ^ScreenType = @ImageData;
	   ImageDataWidthPtr : ^Integer = @ImageData_Width;
	   ImageDataDepthPtr : ^Integer = @ImageData_Depth;
	   ImageDataLengthPtr : ^Integer = @ImageData_Length;

	 begin
	   Offset := ???;     {Replace ??? with position to display block}

	   for X := 0 to ImageDataDepthPtr^-1 do
	     Move (ImageDataPtr^[1+X*ImageDataWidthPtr^*2],
		   Screen[X*160+Offset],ImageDataWidthPtr^*2);
	 end.


       In addition, all the external definitions  for public  identifiers are
       no longer mandatory.   Thus the full screen example reduces to:

	 {$L DEMO.OBJ}
	 procedure ImageData; external;
	 begin
	   Move (pointer(@ImageData)^,ptr($B800,0)^,4000);
	 end.

       People  casually  reviewing  the  literature  for  v6.0/7.0  may  note
       initialized data  is permitted  within object  files now.   Although a
       definite vast  improvement, the  data is  still private  to the object
       file.  Assuming the designers of Turbo Pascal  eventually add external
       variable declarations (similar to C), the Large object file data model
       TheDraw currently supports should be compatible.   Until  then we must
       bear with the current approach for accessing image data.






       TheDraw v4.63           Pull Down Menu System    	    40



       PROGRAMMING IN C:

       C  programmers  have  support  similar  to  that  for pascal.  TheDraw
       creates the Normal, Ascii, and Crunched  file formats  using typical C
       code definitions.  The ImageData arrays are used similar to the pascal
       case.  Please note, in the following examples  it will  be assumed the
       programs are compiled in a state supporting 32-bit data pointers.

       A C NORMAL save is the easiest to display.  For instance:

	 #include <stdio.h>
	 #include <mem.h>
	 #include "image.h"
	 main ()  {
	   /* Kludge a pointer at video memory (segment 0xB800, offset 0) */
	   void far *screen = (void far *) 0xB8000000;
	   memcpy (screen,IMAGEDATA,4000);    /* Move image to screen */
	 }

       The  <mem.h>  file  reference  contains  the  definition of the memcpy
       routine.  Users of Microsoft C  should reference  the <memory.h> file.
       IMAGE.H is  assumed to  contain the array IMAGEDATA created by TheDraw
       (the name may be changed to anything else  naturally).   The void data
       type used is a modern C convention.  If your compiler does not support
       it, use type char instead (or  whatever type  your compiler  wants for
       parameters to memcpy).

       Reminder:
	  Be absolutely sure you are using the proper code/data model.  It is
	  very easy to write  the above  program, only  to have  the compiler
	  complain  about  incompatible  pointer  sizes,  etc... The function
	  memcpy MUST accept full  32  bit  data  pointers.    In  TurboC for
	  instance, you must use memory models Compact, Large, or Huge.

       The above  is for  a full screen image.  To display a block involves a
       little more work, as in the pascal example.

	 #include <stdio.h>
	 #include <mem.h>
	 #include "image.h"
	 main () {
	   void far *screen;
	   int offset = ???;  /* Replace ??? with offset to display block */
	   int x;

	   for (x=0; x<IMAGEDATA_DEPTH; x++) {
	     (long) screen = 0xB8000000+x*160+offset;
	     memcpy (screen,&IMAGEDATA[x*IMAGEDATA_WIDTH*2],IMAGEDATA_WIDTH*2);
	   }
	 }




       TheDraw v4.63           Pull Down Menu System    	    41



       As before, the variables  IMAGEDATA_DEPTH and  IMAGEDATA_WIDTH specify
       the block  size saved in IMAGEDATA, and are generated by TheDraw.  The
       depth is the number of vertical  lines  in  the  block  and  width the
       characters across.   OFFSET contains the video address the block is to
       appear at.  It is computed with:

			     (column*2)+(row*160)-162

				Column varies 1..80
				 Row varies 1..25

       A loop is used in this  example to  move one  line at  a time.   Lines
       from IMAGEDATA  are placed  on the  video at OFFSET.  The address into
       IMAGEDATA is advanced to the location of the  next line  in each loop.
       The  video  address  advances  160  characters for each line (the byte
       width of the video display).

       Programmers with TurboC can  also  use  the  function  puttext.   This
       handles everything  the previous  example did  and is  called with the
       following parameters:

		   XUL    = X coordinate of upper-left corner.
		   YUL    = Y coordinate of upper-left corner.
		   XLR    = X coordinate of lower-right corner.
		   YLR    = Y coordinate of lower-right corner.
		   source = address pointer to data

       Examples of usage are:

	     puttext (1,1,80,25,IMAGEDATA);
		/* full screen display */

	     puttext (1,1,IMAGEDATA_WIDTH,IMAGEDATA_DEPTH,IMAGEDATA);
		/* display block in upper-left corner of screen */

	     puttext (81-IMAGEDATA_WIDTH,26-IMAGEDATA_DEPTH,80,25,IMAGEDATA);
		/* display block in lower-right corner of screen */


       In addition to simplifying the code,  this function  can be  used from
       ANY memory model.  You are not restricted to the larger memory models.
       However, remember this function will only work for NORMAL screen saves
       (not Ascii or Crunched).

       The ASCII  format is  a bit easier to use in C than Pascal.  By taking
       advantage of the 0 terminated strings  of C,  we can  display an ASCII
       image by simply doing the following:

	 #include <stdio.h>
	 #include "image.h"
	 main () {
	   printf ("%s",IMAGEDATA);
	 }

       An alternate technique for displaying ASCII format files is similar to
       the second pascal example (for doing the same thing).  ie:

	 #include <stdio.h>
	 #include <mem.h>
	 #include "image.h"
	 main () {
	   void far *screen;

	   int x;

	   for (x=0; x<4000; x++) {
	     (long) screen = 0xB8000000 + x*2;
	     memcpy (screen,&IMAGEDATA[x],1);
	   }
	 }

       Characters are copied one at a  time from  the IMAGEDATA  array to the
       video memory.   This  is significantly faster than the printf example,
       since the overhead of going through the operating system is removed.

       To use C images CRUNCHED by TheDraw, you must use  the code  in either
       UNCRUN_N.OBJ or  UNCRUN_F.OBJ (depending if you are using a Small/Near
       or Large/Far code model).   The  file UNCRUNCH.H  contains examples on
       their usage.



       USING OBJECT FILES WITH C:

       C  is  normally  implemented  to smoothly interface with object files.
       Follow these steps when using TheDraw object files with C.

	  1) Specify external variables referencing the screen image.
	  2) Tell the compiler make/project utility to  link the  wanted file
	     with your program.

       Notice in  the following  program that  no include  is made.  The file
       containing the image is  not C  source code;  rather, a  binary object
       file merely  needing to  be linked.   Therefore,  we tell the compiler
       what to expect via EXTERN declarations.

	 #include <stdio.h>
	 #include <mem.h>
	 main () {
	   extern int IMAGEDATA_WIDTH;
	   extern int IMAGEDATA_DEPTH;
	   extern int IMAGEDATA_LENGTH;
	   extern unsigned char IMAGEDATA [];

	   void far *screen;
	   int offset = ???;  /* Replace ??? with offset to display block */
	   int x;

	   for (x=0; x<IMAGEDATA_DEPTH; x++) {
	     (long) screen = 0xB8000000+x*160+offset;
	     memcpy (screen,&IMAGEDATA[x*IMAGEDATA_WIDTH*2],IMAGEDATA_WIDTH*2);
	   }
	 }

       Notice  the  image  dimensions  (width,depth,length)  are   stored  as
       variables for easy reference.  The length parameter is not used in the
       example, but shown to demonstrate it.

       The second step is largely dependent on the compiler setup.   You must
       create  or  update  a  make  file to link the necessary TheDraw object
       (.OBJ) file with your program.  If you  use Turbo  C, simply  list the
       file in the project listing.



       PROGRAMMING IN STANDARD BASIC:

       Basic programmers  are a  little more  limited, not  because they lack
       commands, but lack speed.  Therefore  TheDraw creates  the BSave files
       with all  addressing information  already programmed.  All you have to
       do  is  type  'BLOAD  "filename.BSV"'.      The   screen   segment  is
       automatically set,  so you  don't have  to bother  with DEF SEG=etc...
       However, if you wish to override the display segment default,  try the
       following:

	    DEF SEG=&HB800 : BLOAD"filename.BSV"

       For monochrome video users, replace the B800 with B000.

       TheDraw allows  partial block saves for basic files.  These files will
       always be 80 characters wide.  This is a limitation of BLOAD  which we
       all  must  live  with.    They  can start and end on any vertical line
       however, so you could load a  full screen  then just  load small block
       images to  update those parts of the screen needing it.  Make sure you
       build the partial-block images in TheDraw in the exact screen location
       you want them to finally appear.  If you save a block starting on line
       5, and ending on line 8 that is where Basic will display it.

       PROGRAMMING IN MICROSOFT QUICKBASIC v4.0 AND v4.5:

       All the techniques mentioned  for Standard  Basic above  are valid for
       Microsoft's QuickBasic compiler.  However, in QuickBasic v4.0 and v4.5
       additional means are at our disposal.

       TheDraw produces QuickBasic compatible  object files  (.OBJ) which are
       directly linkable.   Each  TheDraw QuickBasic object file contains the
       screen image data  plus  four  functions  for  referencing  that data.
       These  are  shown  as  used  within  QuickBasic,  assuming the default
       identifier of "IMAGEDATA":

			 DECLARE FUNCTION IMAGEDATA&
			 DECLARE FUNCTION IMAGEDATAWIDTH%
			 DECLARE FUNCTION IMAGEDATADEPTH%
			 DECLARE FUNCTION IMAGEDATALENGTH%

       Saving the object file  with a  different identifier,  such as "TEST",
       alters the above accordingly.  ie:

			 DECLARE FUNCTION TEST&
			 DECLARE FUNCTION TESTWIDTH%
			 DECLARE FUNCTION TESTDEPTH%
			 DECLARE FUNCTION TESTLENGTH%

       The functions  are used  in conjunction  with the QB4UTIL.LIB library,
       which contains the display subroutines.  The first function, IMAGEDATA
       (or whatever  identifier name),  returns the location of the data.  It
       is used as a parameter to one of the display subroutines.  ie:

	     CALL UNCRUNCH (IMAGEDATA&, 0)            Use whichever is
	     CALL ASCIIDISPLAY (IMAGEDATA&, 0)     <- appropriate to the
	     CALL NORMALDISPLAY (IMAGEDATA&, 0)       file created by TheDraw

       The next two functions return the  width and  depth dimensions  of the
       screen image  block.   For instance,  a typical screen would return 80
       and 25 respectfully (using EGA/VGA displays  might cause  the depth to
       increase).    These  parameters  are useful for determining window and
       viewport sizes, computing area, etc...

       The last function returns  the length  of the  data as  stored in your
       program.  A crunched image or a small data block could be quite small.
       A 80x25 normal binary screen image would be 4000 bytes.

       To  use  TheDraw  object   files  within   the  QuickBasic  integrated
       environment  requires  the  making  of  a Microsoft Quick Library.  If
       linking together your program externally, the QB4UTIL.LIB file must be
       included  as  it  contains  the  required  Uncrunch, AsciiDisplay, and
       NormalDisplay routines.

       MAKING AND USING QUICK LIBRARIES:

       To  ease  the  use  of  TheDraw  object  files,  a  batch  file called
       MAKEQLB.BAT  is  included.    The  batch  file  creates both the Quick
       Library files (.QLB extension) and separate library files (.LIB).

       Once MAKEQLB has run  successfully,  you  can  use  the  Quick Library
       within the environment.  ie:

				QB /L testfile.QLB

       In addition,  linking at  the Dos  prompt is  simplified since all you
       need include is the one file.  ie:

			LINK program.OBJ+testfile.LIB,,,,;

	      (program.OBJ is assumed created by the BC.EXE compiler)

       MAKEQLB.BAT must  be in  the same  directory as  LINK.EXE, LIB.EXE and
       BRUN40.LIB or  BRUN45.LIB (depending  on your  version of QuickBasic),
       plus the TheDraw object files.  The parameters are:

	      MAKEQLB <targetlib> <objectfile1> <objectfile2> etc...

       The <targetlib> is any library filename you want.  Do -not- put a file
       extension on  this! (see example below)  The batch adds the extensions
       .QLB and .LIB automatically for you.  The  <objectfile> parameters are
       the TheDraw made object files.

       Once the  Quick Library  is constructed,  using the screen images is a
       simple matter of calling a display routine.  The display routines must
       be declare within QuickBasic before they can be called.






       TheDraw v4.63           Pull Down Menu System    	    46



       THE DISPLAY ROUTINES:

       The  file  QB4UTIL.BI  lists  the  display  routine  declarations  for
       convenience.  At the top of your program,  simply include  it with the
       following meta command:

			    REM $INCLUDE: 'QB4UTIL.BI'


       Four routines are declared within this file:

	  UNCRUNCH            Contains  algorithm  needed to display crunched
			      screen images.
	  ASCIIDISPLAY        Display ascii-only object files.
	  NORMALDISPLAY       Display normal binary object files.
	  INITSCREENARRAY     Initialize  a   dynamic   array   for  directly
			      accessing  the  video  screen.    Can  be  used
			      instead of DEF SEG, PEEK, and POKE.


       The actual declarations are:

		   DECLARE SUB UNCRUNCH (X&, Z%)
		   DECLARE SUB ASCIIDISPLAY (X&, Z%)
		   DECLARE SUB NORMALDISPLAY (X&, Z%)
		   DECLARE SUB INITSCREENARRAY (A%())


       The first parameter to  the display  routines is  the identifier saved
       within a given object file (ie: IMAGEDATA&).

       The second  parameter of  each display  call is the video location the
       image will appear.  The upper left screen corner is offset 0 with each
       line taking 160 bytes (each screen character uses two bytes).  ie:

		   line 1 = offset 0
		   line 2 = offset 160
		   line 3 = offset 320
		   line 4 = offset 480
		   etc...

       To compute  an arbitrary  video location,  for any text mode including
       the 43/50 line EGA/VGA modes, use the formula:

		       Video Offset  =  (X-1)*2 + (Y-1)*160

       X is the horizontal column number, and Y is the vertical line number.

       available with  the identifiers  Q1, Q2,  and Q3.   Q1 is crunched, Q2

	  END

       The first call (to  UNCRUNCH) displays  Q1 in  the upper  left corner.
       The second  call (to  ASCIIDISPLAY) displays  IMAGE2 on the sixth line
       down, in  the center  of the  screen (40  characters over).   The file
       QB4UTIL.BI  contains   a  complete  description  of  all  the  display
       routines for you.

       Note in the above  example, everything  available in  a TheDraw object
       file  was  declared  and  used  (the Image, the width, depth, and data
       length) for example purposes.   In  normal use  you need  only declare
       what you  need.   If you  always used 80x25 screens, there would be no
       need to access the image width and depth for instance.

       The INITSCREENARRAY sets up a  dynamic  array  mapped  over  the video
       display.   To directly  manipulate the screen, you can perform various
       useful operations with this  array.   For instance,  the above example
       scrolls the  screen downward  thus clearing  the screen.  You may find
       this more convenient than setting  up  DEF  SEG,  and  using PEEK/POKE
       operations.   Initializing the  array requires the following (the name
       used here is "screen" but can be changed to anything):

	     REM $DYNAMIC
	     DIM SCREEN%()
	     INITSCREENARRAY (SCREEN%())

       After  initializing  the  array,   individual   screen   elements  are
       available.  To put a yellow letter "A" on the screen:

	     SCREEN%(0) = ASC('A') + 256*14

       Compare against  the equivalent PEEK/POKE approach (assume DEF SEG has
       been initialized to &HB800 for color, or &HB000 for monochrome video):

	     POKE 0,ASC('A')
	     POKE 1,14

       Pick whichever approach you feel most comfortable with.

       COMMAND LINE COMPILATION:

       The  above  examples  all  assume  using   the  QuickBasic  integrated
       environment.    For  most  users  this is adequate.  However, the more
       sophisticated user might prefer their  own  text  editor  and  use dos
       compilation.

       Using TheDraw  object files  is done  exactly as described previously.
       Create the .OBJ files, and use  MAKEQLB to  produce the  Quick Library
       (.QLB) and stand alone (.LIB) library files.  ie:

	  MAKEQLB IMAGES IMAGE1.OBJ IMAGE2.OBJ IMAGE3.OBJ

       Compile your source code normally using the BC program.  ie:

	  BC MYCODE.BAS,,,;

       When linking  your program,  simply add  the stand  alone library from
       MAKEQLB to your command line when making your .EXE file:

	  LINK MYCODE+IMAGES.LIB,,,,;

       It is possible to bypass the MAKEQLB step,  but then  all screen image
       objects plus  TheDraw's display  routines must  be added  to your link
       command:

	  LINK MYCODE+QB4UTIL.LIB+IMAGE1+IMAGE2+IMAGE3,,,,;

       The MAKEQLB approach eliminates some of the extra typing in  the final
       command line.   Since  MAKEQLB is  normally run when updating screens,
       using it saves time and cuts down on typing errors.

       PROGRAMMING IN CLIPPER(TM) (courtesy of Ian Thurston):


       A full TheDraw screen saved as  a  BINARY  file  (.BIN)  has  the same
       format as  the Clipper  compiler uses to "SAVE SCREEN TO <expc>".  For
       both Clipper and TheDraw,  a full  text screen  save consists  of 2000
       "words"  (or  4000  bytes).    Each  word represents the character and
       attribute of a single screen location.


       Importing Full-Screen BINARY files:

       We can easily read any file less than 64k bytes into a  Clipper memory
       variable  with  the  "MEMOREAD"  function.  Combining the MEMOREAD and
       RESTORE SCREEN command as follows yields:

	     RESTORE SCREEN FROM MEMOREAD("FULL.BIN")


       Importing Partial-Screen BINARY files:

       Once again, a partial/block TheDraw  screen  saved  to  a  BINARY file
       (using  the  ALT-B,Save  command)  has  the  same  format as Clipper's
       corresponding command:

	     "<expC>=SAVESCREEN(top,left,bottom,right)"

       For example, assume TheDraw was used to prepare a screen.  It was then
       blocked using  ALT-B, with the upper left corner at row 10, column 10,
       while the lower right corner was at  row  20,  column  70.    The Save
       option was  selecting using  the Binary  option, and saved to the file
       "PARTIAL.BIN"

       Again, the TheDraw Binary file is read into a Clipper  memory variable
       using the  "MEMOREAD" function,  which itself  is used as the argument
       for the partial screen restore function RESTSCREEN (t,l,b,r,<expC>):

	     RESTSCREEN (10,10,20,70,MEMOREAD("PARTIAL.BIN"))

       Note:  As is usual with this sort of function, a block can be restored
       at  a  different  screen  location  ...  but the width and height must
       remain the same, else the display  will look  very ugly  indeed.  Also
       correct programming  practice would  have us  check for file existence
       and length before trying these techniques.  You may choose to wrap the
       functions inside a parameter checking shell.

       Combining Multiple BINARY (.BIN) Files:

       If quite  a few  Binary files  will be stored on disk and incorporated
       into an application, why not combine them into one Clipper database to
       simplify  things?    The  process  for accomplishing this is described
       below:

       a. Create a database for .BIN files using the following structure:

	     Structure for database: BIN.DBF

	     Field Field_Name Type        Width    Dec
		 1 BIN_NAME   Character      8
		 2 BIN_TOP    Numeric        2
		 3 BIN_LEFT   Numeric        2
		 4 BIN_BOTTOM Numeric        2
		 5 BIN_RIGHT  Numeric        2
		 6 BIN_SCREEN Memo          10


       b. Using the MEMOREAD function,  import  the  BIN  files  as character
       variables, then  store them in memo field BIN_SCREEN using the REPLACE
       command.  Next, save  the  screen  display  coordinates  into BIN_TOP,
       BIN_LEFT,  BIN_BOTTOM,   and  BIN_RIGHT  (for  a  full  screen,  those
       coordinates are 0,0,24, and 79).  Finally, store a meaningful name for
       the screen in BIN_NAME (ie: "MAINMENU" for a main menu display).

       c. Index the file on BIN_NAME.

       Now to use this file, we need the following function:

       Please note:   When  you save  a box (binary block save) with TheDraw,
       the screen position and dimensions are not recorded in the  .BIN file.
       The box  may be  restored to  your screen  at any position you choose;
       however, the dimensions of the box -cannot- be  changed.   If you try,
       the box  will appear  distorted or  the above routine will generate an
       error.

       Examples:

			       PULL DOWN MENU SYSTEM


       TheDraw can  be fully  controlled via the use of pull down menus.  The
       menus greatly  simplify learning  TheDraw by  conveniently showing all
       related commands.   Each menu also displays the corresponding shortcut
       keystrokes (such as ALT-L for files loading).

       The pull down menus are activated from command  mode using  one of two
       ways.   Pressing either  the [ESC]  key on  the keyboard or if using a
       mouse the RIGHT-most button.   The  following options  bar will appear
       across the top of the screen:

       The FILES Menu
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       The  Files  pull-down  menu  offers  assorted  options  for loading or
       viewing existing files, deleting  old  files,  and  saving  the screen
       image currently  being edited.   When you load a file, it is read into
       the screen edit area.  When done with a file, you can  save it  to any
       directory  or  file  name.    In addition, from this pull-down you can
       change to another directory, temporarily go  to a  Dos Shell,  or exit
       TheDraw completely.

	  being TheDraw will attempt to delete any file you select.


       CHANGE DIR - Change Working Directory (ALT-O)

	  Displays all  subdirectories in  the current directory.  Select the
	  wanted directory by typing  it  in  or  using  the  arrow  keys and
	  pressing  [ENTER].    To  change  to another drive, simply type the
	  wanted drive followed by a colon.  ie: "C:"


       SAVE - Save Current Screen to a File (ALT-S)

	  Saves current screen image to one of a variety of file formats.


       QUIT - Quit/Shell from TheDraw (ALT-X)

	  Allows you to either exit TheDraw  completely or  leave the program
	  just temporarily.  In both cases, you end up at the Dos prompt.

	  To return  to TheDraw  from a Dos Shell, type EXIT.  This is useful
	  when you want to run a DOS command without quitting TheDraw.

       CHARACTER SET - Display and Select Character Set (ALT-F)

	  Shows  a  screen  containing  all  special  IBM  extended character
	  symbols.   From this  you can  select which character set you would
	  like to work with.  Use the arrow keys or the mouse.  Press [ENTER]
	  to save your choice.


       AT-CODES CHART - Quick Reference of PCBoard/Wildcat AT-CODES (ALT-Q)

	  Shows a  window containing the AT-Code commands used by the PCBoard
	  and Wildcat bulletin board systems.   Use arrows  keys or  mouse to
	  scroll,  and  press  [ENTER]  to  place  your  choice into the edit
	  screen.  Note the codes are drawn simply as normal  text, using the
	  current color  attributes.  TheDraw has no awareness of these codes
	  beyond the quick reference chart.  Partly altering  the colors used
	  in a command code affects screen saving.


       TAB SETUP - Adjust TheDraw Tab Stops (ALT-T)

	  This command  permits the  setting of tabs in the editor (positions
	  where the [TAB] key stops).  Initially the  positions are  at every
	  tenth column.   Sub-commands  are available  for setting, clearing,
	  and resetting tabs.

       RULER - On-Screen Ruler (ALT-N)

	  Places a pair of lines on the screen which intersect  at the cursor
	  position.   Move the  ruler using  arrows or the mouse.  [ENTER] or
	  LEFT mouse button saves the new cursor position.   This  command is
	  useful for  aligning items of the screen.  The ruler can be held on
	  the screen by selecting the [S]ticky option.


       PAINT/FILL - Enclosed Area Painter (ALT-P)

	  Lets you fill an enclosed area easily with  characters and/or color
	  attributes.    An  area  is  defined as any shape formed using line
	  characters (from function key sets  1-4).    To  use  this command,
	  position the  cursor inside  the target  area before activating the
	  pull down menus.


       SETUP OPTIONS - Default Setup Configuration (no separate key sequence)

	  Provides access to many  of the  configurable defaults  while using
	  TheDraw.  The following options may be changed:

	  WORKSHEET WIDTH
	     Choose how  wide the  edit buffer  should be.   Either 80 or 160
	     characters.

	  WORKSHEET DEPTH
	     Choose how deep the edit buffer should be.  Can  be 23,  25, 43,
	     50, or  100 lines.  Note the worksheet depth cannot be less than
	     the video mode in use.    For  example,  if  using  43  line EGA
	     editing the worksheet depth may only be 43 or 50 lines.

	     An  exception  is  the  23  line buffer, available only with the
	     standard 80x25 video mode.   Using  the 23  line buffer disables
	     full screen editing and [CTRL-PRTSC] is ignored.

	  VIDEO SCREEN MODE
	     Choose  one  of  the  following  video  edit modes:  Standard 80
	     character by 25 lines (80x25), 80x43 (if using  an EGA  card) or
	     80x50 (if using a VGA card).

	  MAINTAIN FILE DIRECTORY LISTING WILDCARDS
	     Tells TheDraw  to maintain  wildcards specified in the directory
	     listing available during loading  (or  deleting).    For example
	     entering  "*.BIN"  to  see  all  binary  files would normally be
	     forgotten, unless this option was turned on.






       TheDraw v4.63           Pull Down Menu System    	    59




	  DEFAULT SAVE SCREEN FORMAT
	     Default file format TheDraw  should select  when saving  a file.
	     Upon hitting ALT-S, you are present with many choices.  Pressing
	     [ENTER] selects  the default  save screen  format.   If you find
	     yourself  using  a  specific  format often, changing the default
	     might make things easier.

	  DEFAULT LOAD SCREEN FORMAT
	     Similar to the above, but  used  during  loading.    If  you are
	     working with  a given  file type regularly, changing the default
	     load format will saves typing the file extension.   ie:   if set
	     to Binary, "DEMO" becomes "DEMO.BIN" instead of "DEMO.ANS".

	  CREATE BACKUP FILES
	     Instructs TheDraw  to generate  backup files  when saving.  If a
	     file  already  exists,  TheDraw  renames  the   existing  file's
	     extension to .BAK before continuing.

	  SAVING FILENAME PICK LIST ON EXIT TO DOS
	     Controls the  saving of  the filename pick list to disk on exit.
	     When off, any accumulated filenames will be lost upon exit.

	  ASK TO SAVE CHANGES BEFORE EXITING
	     TheDraw can be made to prompt  before allowing  exit to  Dos, if
	     changes were made to the current page or any page.

	  USE ALT-KEY HELP WINDOW
	     Holding  down  the  ALT  key  for about three seconds displays a
	     brief pop-up of available commands.  The feature may be disabled
	     by toggling this option.

	  USE QUICK PALETTE
	     The quick palette is normally available when the pull-down menus
	     are displayed.  If you prefer  not using  the Quick  Palette, it
	     can be disabled with this option.

	  BLANK SCREEN AFTER HOW MANY MINUTES
	     TheDraw will  blank the screen by writing blanks if no action is
	     taken for a specified time.  The time delay can be set from 1 to
	     255 minutes, or turned off completely (value of 0).

	  DISK SWAP FILE PATHNAME
	     Used when  doing a Dos Shell (see ALT-X,S).  TheDraw attempts to
	     write all its data  to expanded  memory or  a disk  swap file to
	     provide more  room during  the shell.   If insufficient expanded
	     memory (EMM or EMS) is available, the disk swap file  is used at
	     the  specified  path.    Leaving  this option blank will prevent
	     TheDraw from using a swap file.





       TheDraw v4.63           Pull Down Menu System    	    60




	  DEFAULT FILENAME EXTENSIONS
	     The default filename extensions TheDraw uses when saving a file.
	     Change  to  your  preference.    For instance, if saving an Ansi
	     file, TheDraw will change "DEMO" into "DEMO.ANS".

	  DEFAULT ASM,PASCAL,C SAVE FORMAT
	     Controls if TheDraw defaults to Normal,  Ascii, or  Crunching of
	     screen data.  See ALT-S for more information.

	  FILTER OUT SOLID SPACES ON TEXT (NON-BINARY) FILES
	     Occasionally   solid   spaces   (entered  with  Shift-Space  key
	     combination) cause  problems with  other programs.   This filter
	     will  convert  all  solid  spaces  to  normal spaces in the data
	     written to disk (for Ansi, Avatar, Ascii, PCBoard, Wildcat, Asm,
	     Pascal, and C formats).

	  FORCE CR/LF ON END OF LINES OF ASCII THAT ARE SCREEN WIDTH
	     TheDraw is  faced with  a dilemma  when saving Ascii files.  The
	     Dos TYPE command automatically wraps the cursor down a line when
	     screen width  text (80 characters) is printed.  TheDraw normally
	     handles this by not writing a  carriage return  sequence (CR/LF)
	     for those  lines, as it is not needed.  However, reading such an
	     Ascii file into other  programs can  cause problems.   Therefore
	     this option  forces TheDraw to always write the CR/LF regardless
	     of anything.  A simple, yet effective, solution.

	  OUTPUT ANY BLANK LINES ON BOTTOM OF FULL-SCREEN SAVE
	     Many times a screen  does not  use the  entire video.   To avoid
	     TheDraw outputing the extra blank lines present on the bottom of
	     such screens, this option can be used.   It will  generate files
	     equivalent to using a block save command.

	  RESET COLORS TO WHITE ON END OF ANSI FILES
	     Controls if TheDraw resets the Ansi colors to white after all is
	     said and done.  Generally of use in  animation files,  where the
	     last character printed is flashing magenta on a green background
	     (or some even worse color combination).

	  DEFAULT ANSI VIDEO PREPARATION
	     Choose if by default TheDraw does  nothing, homes  the cursor to
	     the  upper  left  screen  corder,  or  clears  the screen before
	     displaying an Ansi file.

	  DEFAULT ANSI SLOW DOWN FACTOR
	     Choose how many delay elements TheDraw  inserts by  default into
	     an  Ansi  file.    Normally  used  on  faster  machines  to make
	     animation more appealing (ie: visible).






       TheDraw v4.63           Pull Down Menu System    	    61




	  MAXIMUM ANSI LINE LENGTH
	     Controls the maximum line length TheDraw  will permit  a line of
	     Ansi  to  become.    Some  programs have line length limitations
	     (such as bulletin board systems).  Since TheDraw can conceivable
	     generate lines  thousands of characters long, this option allows
	     you to compensate.   The  setting  can  be  between  32  and 255
	     characters, or set to Unlimited if no conflicts exist.

       The FONTS Menu
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       The Fonts  pulldown menu  supports choosing various styles and outline
       types.  The menu shown below  is only  an example.   The  actual fonts
       available can  vary depending on your configuration.  Additional fonts
       may be present, or  the  ones  shown  changed.    Ascii  fonts  can be
       extremely useful  in sprucing  up a  display.   They are excellent for
       title bars, or whatever you desire.  Upon choosing an  Ascii font, the
       word "FONT" will appear in the status line.

       STANDARD FONT:

       The standard  font is  the normal  text lettering associated with each
       key.  This is the default setting upon loading TheDraw.   The standard
       font is used for lettering seen in the help screens, the pulldown menu
       bar, status line, etc...


       OUTLINE TYPE - Choose a Font Outline:

       The outline type option  is only  available when  an outline formatted
       font  is  selected.    These  are  indicated  with  an  asterisk ("*")
       appearing after the font description.    Outline  formatted  fonts are
       special in  that they  can appear  in different  styles.  There are 17
       various styles to choose from.  Some examples are:

			  旼컴컴     旼컴컴     幡賽賽

       TheDraw v4.63           Pull Down Menu System    	    64




       FONT SELECTION:

       Remaining options in the fonts submenu select specific fonts.  TheDraw
       supports the entire visible Ascii character set (#33 to #126).  ie:

		  !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO
		  PQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~

       Extended function key symbols are not currently supported.  To enter a
       given symbol to the edit screen,  simply press  the corresponding key.
       ie: for  a letter "A", type the "A" key.  The symbol will appear fully
       in the current color attributes.

       Not all symbols are necessarily available  in all  fonts.   Some fonts
       may only  provide the alphabet and numbers.  TheDraw beeps if a wanted
       symbol is not available.  The original fonts  distributed with TheDraw
       do not contain any omissions.

       Once a  font has  been selected,  the word  "FONT" replaces the "Text"
       indicator on the status  line as  a reminder.   In  addition, once you
       start typing  symbols the cursor becomes a full block.  So long as the
       full block cursor is shown, you can use  the BackSpace  key to correct
       mistakes  on  the  fly.    Press  ALT-R  (Restore/Undo)  to remove any
       undesired key sequences completely.

       There are three main types  of  fonts:    Normal  block,  Outline, and
       Multi-Color fonts.   Normal  fonts are just simple block images.  They
       are drawn using the  current  color  attributes.    Outline  fonts are
       special in that the way they are drawn can be changed on the fly using
       the OUTLINE TYPE command (described above).   Multi-color  fonts are a
       special breed that define fixed colors in addition to characters.  The
       current color attributes are ignored.

       Outline fonts  are indicated  by an  asterisk "*"  appearing after the
       description.  Multi-color fonts a letter "C".

       The ANIMATION Menu
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Provides  various  facilities  for  working with the TheDraw animation
       system.  Options  allow  the  display  and  editing  of  the animation
       sequence.    The  registered  version  of  TheDraw  adds  Limiting and
       animation markers (as shown below).  Note this menu is  only available
       when TheDraw is actually in animation mode - otherwise it is disabled.

       SCREEN REDRAW - Display the Entire Animation Sequence (ALT-Q)

	  Display the  animation sequence  as entered.  The command is useful
	  for seeing how your work is progressing.   The speed  of the redraw
	  may be  controlled by  specifying a  number between 0 (fastest) and
	  255 (slowest).


       AUTO REPEAT REDRAW - Display Animation Sequence Repeatedly (ALT-Q,A)

	  Identical to screen redraw, except the animation sequence  is drawn
	  over  and  over  continuously.    You  must  press a key to end the
	  presentation.


       CHANGE CHARACTER - Edit a Character in Animation Sequence (ALT-W)

	  Allows the editing of a mistyped  animation entry.   Animation mode
	  differs  from  the  normal  edit  mode  in that simply overtyping a
	  character does not replace it.  In animation mode, both entries are
	  remembered -  the incorrect  character, plus  the wanted one.  This
	  command can changes entries without adding unwanted new ones.




       TheDraw v4.63           Pull Down Menu System    	    66




       ERASE CHARACTER - Delete a Character from Animation Sequence (ALT-Z)

	  Deletes characters from the animation sequence.  As stated above in
	  the CHANGE CHARACTER option, a character is not replaced or deleted
	  in animation mode by overtyping.   To erase  something this command
	  must  be  used.    Only  the  top-most character (the one currently
	  visible) is removed; anything under it is left intact.


       INCLUDE FILES - Ansi/Ascii Include Files (ALT-J,Include)

	  Allows text files created by  programs  other  than  TheDraw  to be
	  inserted into  Animation sequences.   Particularly  useful for Ansi
	  Music, BBS control codes, and often used sequences.


       LIMITING - Animation Sequence Editing (ALT-J,Limit) - Registered

	  Limiting gives  total control  over the  animation sequence, making
	  changes anywhere  trivial.   Normally all changes and additions are
	  done on the end of the animation sequence.  By  using limiting, you
	  can move the edit point to anywhere within the sequence.

	  Once the limit point has been set, TheDraw operates only up to that
	  point.  All deletions, additions and correcting are  done where the
	  limit is  specified.  Everything in the sequence above the limit is
	  protected, temporarily out of the way.


       MARKER - Animation Markers (ALT-J,marKer) - Registered

	  Markers are  used  to  "mark"  or  "tag"  different  places  in the
	  animation sequence  for later  reference.  Once set, markers can be
	  used for quickly changing the animation limit position  (see above)
	  and viewing specific portions of the animation sequence.


       MOVEMENT STORAGE - Cursor Movement Storage (ALT-J,Movement)

	  Controls whether  or not cursor movement is stored in the animation
	  sequence.    Normally  only   characters  specifically   typed  are
	  recorded.   With this  option turned  on however,  movements of the
	  cursor are also saved (for example, using the mouse or arrow keys).


       RESCAN ANIMATION - Animation Screen Rescanning (ALT-J,Rescan)

	  Creates a new animation  sequence using  the current  screen image.
	  Any previous animation is lost (unless in animation limiting mode).




       TheDraw v4.63           Pull Down Menu System    	    67




       PAUSE ANIMATION - Animation Pausing (ALT-J,Pause)

	  Inserts  either  a  keyboard  or  timed  pause  into  the animation
	  sequence.   Gives the opportunity to sit and reflect upon a certain
	  presentation.  Note these pauses are  truly functional  only within
	  TheDraw or  THEPP (The Presentation Program).  In Ansi files, timed
	  pauses cannot be accurately saved.  Keyboard pauses  are flatly not
	  possible with standard Ansi.



       The COLOR Menu
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Use this menu to select edit colors.  Available options set the normal
       edit foreground and background  color,  the  default  background color
       used for  erasing areas,  and "picking up" colors currently used under
       the cursor.

	  also CTRL-UP/DOWN.


       DEFAULT - Change Default Erase Background Color (ALT-D)

	  whenever  TheDraw  must  erase  an  area,  or otherwise deal with a
	  "void" created by some operation.


       UNDER CURSOR - Use Colors Currently Under Cursor (ALT-U)

       SHADING - Select Color Shading Combination (ALT-A,A)

	  Present only in the registered version of TheDraw.   It  is derived
	  from  the  SHADING.TD  example  file distributed with the shareware
	  version of TheDraw.  Incorporated  in  the  registered  version, it
	  provides a powerful and easy to use tool.

	  A screen is shown containing all available color combinations, when
	  used in conjunction with the block symbols from function key set 6:

				    같  굇  께

	  Pressing the [SPACE] bar  toggles the  color highlight  on any off.
	  Use  the  arrow  keys  to  select  a color.  The current colors are
	  spelled out along the bottom of the selection window.

	  Press [ENTER]  to  choose  a  color.    The  block  symbol selected
	  becomes the  current "picked"  character, and  can be used with the
	  manual painting keystrokes (shift arrow-keys).

	  Turns on/off  color attribute drawing mode.  Color drawing involves
	  simply changing characters to the current colors.  A manual  way of
	  easily painting an area a given color.


       SPRITE MODE - Sprite Editing Toggle (ALT-E,Toggle)

	  Turns on/off  TheDraw Sprite  Editing Mode.   Please refer to ALT-E
	  for discussion about this mode.


       ANIMATION MODE - Animation Mode Toggle (ALT-J)

	  Changes TheDraw from Normal to Animation mode and visa versa.  When
	  going from  Normal to  Animation mode,  a list  of available screen
	  scanners are presented.  Refer to ALT-J for more details.


       PICK CHARACTER - Select Current Character for Manual Painting (ALT-/)

	  Toggles  manual  painting,  using  the  character  currently  under
	  cursor.   It is  indicated by  a "x"  structure in  the status line
	  (where 'x' is the symbol chosen).    You  manually  paint  with the
	  Shift  Arrow-Key  combinations  (ie:  Shift-Up-Arrow,  Shift-Right-
	  Arrow, etc...).

	  Other ways to pick characters include  using the  Quick Palette, or
	  the  color  Shading  screen  available  in  the registered version.
	  Manual painting is turned off by  picking  up  the  same  symbol as
	  currently selected.


       INSERT MODE - Character Insert Mode Toggle (INS)

	  Turns  on/off  character  insert  mode.    In  insert  mode, typing
	  something bumps everything to the right  to make  room for  the new
	  character.


       FULL SCREEN - Full Screen Editing Toggle (CTRL-PRTSC)

       The HELP Option
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       This is not really a pulldown menu at all.  Rather, it is a entry into
       the outline help screens of  TheDraw.    The  four  screens  provide a
       general overview of most functions in the program.



       The QUICK PALETTE Window
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       The  Quick  Palette  is  perhaps  one  of the easiest ways of choosing
       colors and  extended characters;  especially if  using a  mouse.  This
       window appears  at the  same time as the pull down menu bar.  From the
       keyboard type either [ALT-Q] or the [TAB] key to select.   Mouse users
       simply need move the pointer over the window.

       There are  four fields.   The  top three are for choosing a foreground
       color, toggling the blink attribute, and choosing a background color.
       Mouse users need only click on the desired color to  select.  Keyboard
       users must  use the  CTRL-Up/Down/Left/Right arrow key combinations to
       change colors using the Quick Palette.

       The  bottom  field  contains   most  extended   character  attributes.
       Choosing  an  extended  character  from  the  Quick Palette does three
       things for you:

	  o  Places the character onto the edit screen at the cursor.
	  o  It makes that character the "picked" symbol for manual painting.
	  o  It changes the current function key set to the one containing
	       the specified symbol.

       Keyboard users move around in the  bottom field  with the  arrow keys.
       Press [ENTER] to choose a symbol.

       This  can  be  very  helpful  for quickly using odd symbols, which are
       spread across multiple function  key sets.   Instead  of typing ALT-F,
       finding the  symbol, selecting a set, then hitting the proper function
       key, you now simply point and click.  What could be easier?

       The Quick Palette does not contain  all of  the line  drawing symbols.
       Typically there  is no  point in using the manual paint mode for these
       symbols, as the line drawing toggle (ALT-M) is available.   The act of
       choosing the function key set can be useful though, and is provided.

			     THEDRAW KEYBOARD COMMANDS


			ALT-A: CHANGE TEXT COLOR ATTRIBUTES

       This function  allows you  to change the current color attributes used
       by TheDraw.  These attributes "color" any new characters placed on the
       screen.   When you press ALT-A, the screen will change to a display of
       the available and currently selected colors.

       The lower portion of the screen contains two prompts:

		      Please Select Foreground Color (0-31):
		      Please Select Background Color  (0-7):

       The cursor will be flashing immediately after the  first prompt.   You
       can now change the current foreground color via the Up/Down arrow keys
       or by directly typing  the number  associated with  a foreground color
       (see table  below).   Mouse users can position the mouse on the wanted
       color then press a button.

		   0  Black     	     8  Dark Gray
		   1  Blue      	     9  Light Blue
		   2  Green     	    10  Light Green
		   3  Cyan      	    11  Light Cyan
		   4  Red       	    12  Light Red
		   5  Magenta   	    13  Light Magenta
		   6  Brown     	    14  Yellow
		   7  Light Gray	    15  White

       Characters can be made to blink by selecting colors from  the range 16
       through 31.  These match the above exactly, except they blink.

       After  changing  the  foreground  color  (or leaving it alone) you can
       either proceed to the background colors  by pressing  [ENTER] or press
       [ESC] to  return to the edit screen.  The background color is selected
       in a fashion similar to the above.  Allowed values are the first eight
       (0 through  7) colors.   There are no background colors available that
       allow background blinking.

       Pressing either [ENTER] or [ESC] at this point will return to the edit
       screen.

       Notes:   It  is  possible  to  change  the colors without using ALT-A.
		Please see the Ctrl-<Arrow Key> commands for more details
		(ie: Ctrl-<Up Arrow>, Ctrl-<Left Arrow>, etc...)

		Monochrome screen users will find background colors generally
		useless except when set to light gray (7) while using a black
		foreground color of 0 or 16 (blinking black).

       COLOR SHADING SCREEN
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       The registered version of TheDraw includes  a built-in  version of the
       SHADING.TD example  file (distributed with the shareware release).  As
       incorporated into the registered version, it  provides a  powerful and
       easy to use aid in color mixing and selection.

       To reach  this screen,  type ALT-A  from the change attributes screen.
       From the edit screen type ALT-A twice, or pick the Shading option from
       the COLORS pulldown menu.

       A screen  will appear  showing all  available color combinations using
       along with the block symbols from function key set 6:  같  굇  께

       Pressing the [SPACE] bar toggles the color highlight on any  off.  Use
       the arrow  keys to select a color.  The current colors are spelled out
       along the bottom of the selection window.

       Press [ENTER] to choose a color.   The  block symbol  selected becomes
       the  current  "picked"  character,  and  can  be  used with the manual
       painting keystrokes (shift arrow-keys).



			   ALT-B: BLOCK ACTION COMMANDS

       The Block Action Commands  provide  many  facilities  for  editing the
       current screen  and making  extensive changes.   The following options
       are available:

	  o  Move or Copy blocks of text.
	  o  Fill in areas with characters, colors or both.
	  o  Perform left, right or center text justification.
	  o  Draw boxes or outline text with lines quickly and easily.
	  o  Delete or simply Erase blocks of text.
	  o  Load a block of screen area from a file on disk.
	  o  Save just a piece of the current screen to disk.
	  o  Rescan an area into animation sequence (animation mode only).

       The Block Action Commands in TheDraw are one of the  more useful tools
       available.  After pressing ALT-B, you will see the following prompt:

	 Use [L]ast block or move to Upper-Left corner and press [SPACE].

       Press [L]  to use  the last  block specified.   Otherwise define a new
       block by indicating the upper-left and  lower-right corners.   Use the
       arrow keys,  PgUp, PgDn,  Home or End keys on the keyboard to move the
       cursor to  the wanted  locations, then  press [SPACE]  after you reach
       each point.




       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    73




       The current block is highlighted (colors inverted) to make it obvious.
       Once you define the upper-left corner of the block, moving above or to
       the left  of it will not invert any text.  TheDraw will stop the block
       marking if you press [SPACE] under this situation.

       Upon pressing  [SPACE] the  second time  (with an  inverted block) you
       will see  the available block option commands.  Mouse users may mark a
       block by pressing and holding the LEFT mouse button, moving  the mouse
       to wanted block size, and releasing.


       COPY - Copy a Block

	  Copies the marked block.  Use mouse or normal cursor movement keys,
	  such as the arrow keys, Tab, PgUp, PgDn,  Home or  End to  move the
	  block copy around.  Available sub-commands are:

		pagE   - Change to  a different page layer screen.  With this
			 option you can choose to stamp (see below) copies of
			 the block  on other  layers.  A small window appears
			 with a prompt for  the  new  page  layer.    Enter a
			 number or press [ESC] to abort.

		Toggle - Toggles  between  single  layer  and  sprite editing
			 modes (see ALT-E for discussion on  sprite editing).
			 In sprite  mode, any  text on a higher numbered page
			 layer will appear "under" text on the current page.

		Stamp  - Makes a copy of the  current  block  at  the current
			 position.    Additional  copies  can be made as many
			 times as wished.

		Under  - Toggles between moving the block "above"  or "under"
			 the current  page layer.   The  block copy starts in
			 above mode.   In  above  mode  the  entire  block is
			 visible,  no  matter  where  it  is moved.  In under
			 mode, the block appears UNDER any other text  on the
			 current page  layer.   It will only show through the
			 black spaces on the current layer.

			 Note:     Under  mode  also  allows  an  interesting
				   effect.    If  you are sprite editing (see
				   ALT-E command) the  block  will  appear to
				   move -between- the current layer and those
				   below it.

		[ENTER]  Saves all changes made to all layers.

		[ESC]    Aborts and removes all changes made to all layers.

       MOVE - Move a Block

	  Moving a block operates identically to copying a block (see above).
	  The  only  difference  is  the  block is "cut" out from the current
	  screen, leaving a hole behind.  This hole is filled with spaces and
	  the default background color (see ALT-D command).  All sub-commands
	  are identical to the block copy described above.   Under animation,
	  the exact pattern of a the shifted animation sequence is relocated.

       FILL - Fill a Block

	  Fills the marked block  based  on  a  specified  sub-command.   The
	  available options are listed below:

		Attribute - Changes  both  foreground  and  background  color
			    attributes to current status line values.

		Fore      - Changes just  the foreground  color attributes to
			    current values shown in status line.

		bacK      - Changes just  the background  color attributes to
			    current values shown in status line.

		Use       - Changes  both  foreground  and  background  color
			    attributes  to  those  under  the CURSOR when you
			    first pressed ALT-B.  This is  not the upper-left
			    block corner,  but the position on the screen the
			    cursor  was  sitting  when  block  commands  were
			    first selected.

		Character - Prompts  for  a  keyboard  character  or  special
			    function set symbol (see  ALT-F command).   Solid
			    spaces can  be used by pressing Shift-Space.  The
			    block  is  then  overwritten  using  whatever was
			    selected.   The color  attributes at a given spot
			    are not changed, just the character there.

		Both      - Combines both the  Attribute  and  Character fill
			    operations  described  above.    A  character  is
			    prompted for, then  everything  in  the  block is
			    overwritten using that character with the current
			    color attributes from the status line.

	  These  commands  offer  much  flexibility;  however,  nothing  will
	  satisfy everyone.   For  this reason,  the "last  block" option was
	  added.  To perform  multiple fill  operations on  a given  block is
	  now done quickly and easily.

	  Note: In animation mode, the Attribute, Fore, bacK, and Use options
		actually change characters in the animation  sequence (no new
		characters  are  added).    The Character and Both options in
		Animator mode ADD to the animation sequence.

       TEXT - Block Text Operations

	  Performs various text operations on the specified block.  Available
	  sub-commands are:

		Box     - Draws a  box using  the current  function set.  The
			  box border is defined by  the  edges  of  the block
			  area.   The contents of the box are left unchanged,
			  however anything where the  box lines  are actually
			  drawn will be overwritten.

		Outline - Operates  similar  to  the  Box command, except the
			  contents of the block are examined first.   The box
			  border  will  be  adjusted  to just accommodate all
			  words either fully or  partially  contained  by the
			  block area.

			  For  instance,  assume  just  one  character in the
			  center of the  edit  screen.    You  then  mark the
			  entire screen  as a block, and select text outline.
			  The result would only be  a  small  box  around the
			  character.

			  Going the  other way,  if you block marked just the
			  center letter of a long word  (with no  spaces) the
			  block edges  would expand to accommodate the entire
			  word.   Note: the expansion is only  done for words
			  INITIALLY part  of the  block.  Any words the block
			  expansion happens to go  over are  ignored, and are
			  not considered by Text Outline.

		Center  - Text contained  or partially contained by the block
			  is centered.  The  way this  is done  is similar to
			  the  text  Outline  described  above.  Each line of
			  characters considered  is expanded  to just enclose
			  all words.  The string of words is then centered on
			  the position of the block.

		Left    - Text contained or partially  contained is  moved to
			  the  left  edge  of  the block.  Block expansion is
			  used so words are not split apart.

		Right   - Identical to  Left  except  contained  or partially
			  contained text  is moved  to the  right edge of the
			  block.


	  These  commands  are  useful  making  menu  displays,  short memos,
	  letters, etc...

       DELETE - Delete a Block

	  This command is fairly intuitive.  The block is completely removed.
	  Anything on the edit screen to the right of the block is shift over
	  to fill  in the space.  The area previously occupied by the shifted
	  text is erased using spaces and  the default  background color (see
	  the ALT-D).


       ERASE - Erase a Block

	  Erases the  block, without  changing anything  other portion of the
	  edit screen.  The block is  erased  using  spaces  and  the default
	  background color (see ALT-D).


       REPLACE - Block Character/Color Replace

	  Performs  character  and/or  color  attribute  replacement on block
	  based on specified sub-command.  The pattern is  whatever was under
	  the  cursor  when  ALT-G  was  selected.  The available options are
	  shown below (these are similar to the Fill options):

		Attribute -   Searches both foreground  and  background color
			      attributes,  then  replaces  all  matches  with
			      current values shown on status line.

		Fore       -  Searches and replaces just the foreground color
			      attributes with current value.

		bacK       -  Searches and replaces just the background color
			      attributes with current value.

		Character -   Prompts for  a  keyboard  character  or special
			      function set symbol (see ALT-F command).  Solid
			      spaces can  be  used  by  pressing Shift-Space.
			      The block  is then  searched and all characters
			      matching the pattern are replaced with  the new
			      selection.    Color  attributes at any position
			      are not changed, just character values.

		Both       -  Combines  both  the  Attribute   and  Character
			      operations  described  above.    A  replacement
			      character is  prompted for,  then everything on
			      the screen matching the pattern (both character
			      and fore/back attributes) is  replaced with the
			      character and current colors.






       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    77



       The following  commands are  available only  in normal (non-animation)
       screen edit mode:

       LOAD - Load a Block

	  Imports a block of data from another screen saved on disk.  You are
	  first prompted  for the  import filespec  (see ALT-L for details on
	  loading files).

	  The import image is then loaded  onto the  screen, and  an inverted
	  area of  the defined  block size  appears.  Move this inverted area
	  using arrow keys, PgUp, PgDn, Home  or End  to the  wanted portion.
	  Press [ENTER]  to save  a copy of the inverted area in the original
	  edit screen.  The rest of the import image is discarded.


       SAVE - Save a Block

	  Operates almost identically to the normal save screen  command (see
	  ALT-S  for  information  on  saving  edit screens).  The difference
	  being the save is restricted to the defined block.

       -----

       The following are available only in animation edit mode:

       FADEOUT - Animation Fadeout Fill

	  Identical to the block fill command;  however, in  addition you are
	  prompted  for  an  animation  scanner.    This option gives you the
	  ability to easily have a screen appear using  one animation effect,
	  then be erasing using another.


       RESCAN - Rescan a Block

	  Operates just  like the  ALT-J animator  rescan option, except only
	  the marked block is rescanned.   The  marked  block  area  is first
	  erased from the animation sequence, then the block is rescanned and
	  added onto the end of sequence.



			    ALT-C: CLEAR CURRENT SCREEN

       The operation of this command should be apparent.  Once  selected, the
       following prompt appears:

	  Do you want to CLEAR this Page or All Page Layers? (Yes/No/All)

       Selecting [Y]es  or pressing [ENTER] will clear the current page layer
       and nothing else.   Selecting [N]o  or pressing  [ESC] will  abort the


       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    78



       command.    Selecting  [A]ll  will  clear  ALL  page  layers.  You are
       prompted to verify this request before continuing.  Useful if you want
       a completely clean slate.

       The clearing  of a  given page  layer is  done by using spaces and the
       default background  color  (see  ALT-D).    The  clear  screen  can be
       reversed using the Restore/Undo command (see ALT-R).



			ALT-D: SET DEFAULT BACKGROUND COLOR

       The default  background color  is used  whenever TheDraw  must erase a
       portion of the screen.  Examples of commands where this is used are:

	  o  Clear Current Screen.
	  o  Block Delete, Erase, and Move.
	  o  Text Operations which move words.
	  o  Use of the Backspace or Delete keys to remove characters.
	  o  Inserting or Deleting of lines or columns.

       All these commands "clear"  an  area  of  the  screen  in  one  way or
       another.   TheDraw does  this using  spaces and the default background
       color specified.

       When you select ALT-D, the screen  changes to  a display  of available
       colors and the current default background color.  In the lower portion
       of the screen is the prompt:

		       Please Select Background Color (0-7):

       The cursor will be flashing after  this  prompt.    Select  the wanted
       default background  color via  the Up/Down  arrow keys  or by directly
       entering the number associated with a  color (see  ALT-A for available
       colors).   Mouse users  simply position  the mouse on the wanted color
       and press a button.

       Press [ENTER] or [ESC] to return to the edit screen.




		      ALT-E: CHANGE PAGE LAYER/TOGGLE SPRITES

       The change page layer command allows  you to  select a  different page
       layer for  editing.   Up to  eight simultaneous  layers can be used at
       once, in either normal or animation  modes.   With this  facility, you
       can load several images, copy/exchange parts and do much more.

       After pressing ALT-E, the following prompt appears:

	     Display Page Layer (1-8), Toggle Single/Layers, or [ESC]?


       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    79




       The number  of available  layers (8  here) will  vary depending on how
       TheDraw has been configured.  To select a different page layer, simply
       press the  number.   The second  option, [T]oggle Single/Layers, is to
       toggle the  sprite  editing  facility  of  TheDraw.    Sprite  mode is
       indicated by  the word  "Page" or  "Anim" appearing in capital letters
       on the status line (ie: PAGE).

       Sprite editing allows you to see  everything "underneath"  the current
       page layer.   Imagine  several sheets  of glass, stacked on top of one
       another.  If you look  down  from  the  top-most  sheet,  you  can see
       anything placed on a piece of glass lower down.

       The sprite  editing mode  of TheDraw  is akin  to the  layers of glass
       described above.  In  this case,  layer one  is the  top-most sheet of
       glass.  Page layer eight (8) is the bottom-most sheet of glass.  ie:

				       旼컴컴컴커
				      .      . 
				    .      .    Bottom-Most Layer
				 旼컴컴컴커    8
			       旼좔컴컴커 냐컴컴
			     旼좔컴컴커     .
			              3 .
	      Top-Most Layer         2쳐
			            1쳐
			     읕컴컴컴켸

       Naturally,  an  object  or  character  closer  to  the  top will cover
       anything under it.  In TheDraw, anything other than a  non-solid black
       space will  conceal the contents of a lower layer (see SHIFT-SPACE for
       information on solid spaces).

       Another useful feature about sprite editing  is only  the current page
       layer may  be changed.  Nothing you do will alter a layer below (short
       of clearing all layers), even though  you can  see its  contents.  The
       current layer  can be  globally moved, have lines inserted or deleted,
       etc...  Anything  lower  down  is  protected  unless  you specifically
       change to that page layer for editing.

       The question than now comes to mind is:  What can be done with it?
       Imagine  you  have  a  screen  made  of  several distinct parts, say a
       backdrop with figures on it.  Now a figure must be moved  to make room
       for something  else.   Unless "block"  shaped, the  block move command
       (ALT-B) is tedious to use.  For something  tree shaped,  an easier way
       is desired.

       Using sprite  editing each  figure could  have its own layer, with the
       backdrop placed on the  bottom-most  page.    To  move  a  figure, you
       merely  switch  to  its  layer  and use the global screen move command
       (ALT-G,M).  Nothing could be simpler.    To  see  the  result  of your
       change, switch back to the top-most layer.


       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    80




       Menu making  is made easier with sprites also.  Put together the basic
       outline (lines, boxes, etc...) on one page layer,  then switch  to one
       higher up  for the text.  If you do not like the initial text, erasing
       it will not harm the outline.   There  are endless  more possibilities
       waiting to be discovered.



			   ALT-F: VIEW FUNCTION KEY SETS

       This command presents a display of the 150 special extended characters
       supported by TheDraw.  These characters are stored in fifteen separate
       "function  key  sets".    The  current set is displayed on the TheDraw
       status line.

       Selecting function key sets within  this  display  is  done  using the
       Up/Down arrow  keys or  using the  mouse.   Press [ENTER] or click the
       mouse button when satisfied.

       The  actual  characters  are  accessed  using  the  function  keys  by
       themselves.   If function  key set 7 was selected, pressing [F2] would
       display the second character in that set (a smiley face).

       ----

       An alternate means for selecting function  key sets  is available from
       the normal  edit screen.   To use function key sets 1 to 10, press ALT
       followed by a function key 1 to 10.  To  use function  key sets  11 to
       15, press CTRL followed by a function key 1 to 5.  ie:

		       ALT-F7 will select function key set 7
		      CTRL-F4 will select function key set 14

       Note:    Appendix  C   contains  a  list  of  all  special  characters
		supported by the IBM-PC  extended  character  set  in numeric
		order.    To  access  these  characters  -without-  using the
		function key sets, press and hold  down  the  ALT  key.   Now
		using the numeric keypad on the side of the keyboard, type in
		the number associated with the wanted character.   Once done,
		release the  ALT key.   The  character will then appear.  ie:
		press and hold ALT.  Now type 65  on the  numeric keypad, and
		release ALT.  The letter "A" will appear.

			      ALT-G: GLOBAL COMMANDS

       The global  commands offer  many facilities for doing "global" changes
       to the entire screen.  All of these commands could  be duplicated with
       block  operations;   they  exist   for  convenience.    The  following
       selections are available:

	  o  Copy the current screen to another page layer.
	  o  Move/Rotate the current screen around its borders.
	  o  Globally fill the screen with colors and/or characters.
	  o  Perform text operations globally on the screen.
	  o  Globally replace a character or color with something else.

       After pressing ALT-G the available commands are listed.


       COPY - Copy Screen

	  The command first prompts  for the  destination page.   The current
	  screen is then copied to the specified page layer.

	  In  animation  mode,  this  deletes  everything  on the destination
	  layer.  The current screen is then copied item by item to it.


       MOVE - Move/Rotate Screen

	  Moves the entire screen around its borders.  Use the arrows keys to
	  rotate the  screen.  Press [ENTER] when satisfied or [ESC] to leave
	  the screen as it was.   ie: moving the screen upwards will "rotate"
	  the line at the top of the screen down to the bottom of the screen.


       FILL - Fill Screen

	  Fills  the  entire  screen  based  on a specified sub-command.  The
	  available options are listed  below  (these  are  identical  to the
	  block fill commands):

		Attribute - Changes  both  foreground  and  background  color
			    attributes  to  current  values  shown  in status
			    line.

		Fore      - Changes just  the foreground  color attributes to
			    current values shown in status line.

		bacK      - Changes just  the background  color attributes to
			    current values shown in status line.

		Use       - Changes  both  foreground  and  background  color
			    attributes to those  under  the  CURSOR  when you
			    first pressed ALT-G.  This is the position on the
			    screen  the   cursor  was   sitting  when  global
			    commands were selected.

		Character - Prompts  for  a  keyboard  character  or  special
			    function set symbol (see  ALT-F command).   Solid
			    spaces can  be used by pressing Shift-Space.  The
			    screen is  then  overwritten  using  whatever was
			    selected.    The  color  attributes  at any given
			    position are not changed,  just the  character at
			    that position.

		Both      - Combines  both  the  Attribute and Character fill
			    operations  described  above.    A  character  is
			    prompted  for,  then  everything on the screen is
			    overwritten using that character with the current
			    color attributes from the status line.


	  In animation  mode, the Attribute, Fore, bacK, and Use options only
	  alter characters already in  the animation  sequence (no additional
	  characters are  added).  The Character or Both options however WILL
	  add additional characters to the animation sequence.


       FADEOUT - Animation Fadeout Fill (animation mode only)

	  Identical to the global fill command; however, in  addition you are
	  prompted  for  an  animation  scanner.    This option gives you the
	  ability to easily have a screen appear using  one animation effect,
	  then be erasing using another.


       TEXT - Global Text Operations

	  Performs  various  text  operations  on the screen.  Available sub-
	  commands are:

		Box     - Draws a box using  the current  function set.   The
			  box border  will be the defined by the edges of the
			  screen.  The inside of the  box is  left unchanged,
			  however anything  where the  box lines are actually
			  drawn will be overwritten.

		Outline - Operates similar to the  Box  command,  however the
			  contents of  the block are examined first.  The box
			  border will be  adjusted  to  just  accommodate all
			  words contained by the screen.



       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    83



			  For instance,  assume you just had one character in
			  the center of the edit screen.  The result of using
			  global  text  outline  would  only  be  a small box
			  around the character.

		Center  - Text in the screen  is centered.   The  way this is
			  done  is  similar  to  the  text  Outline described
			  above.    Each  line  of  characters  considered is
			  reduced to  just enclose  all words.  The string of
			  words is then centered in the screen.

		Left    - Text is moved to the left edge of the screen.

		Right   - Identical to Left except text is moved to the right
			  edge of the screen.


       REPLACE - Global Character/Color Replace

	  Performs  character  and/or  color  attribute replacement on entire
	  screen based on specified sub-command.  The pattern is whatever was
	  under the  cursor when  ALT-G was  selected.  The available options
	  are shown below (these are similar to the Fill options):

		Attribute -   Searches both foreground  and  background color
			      attributes,  then  replaces  all  matches  with
			      current values shown on status line.

		Fore       -  Searches and replaces just the foreground color
			      attributes with current value.

		bacK       -  Searches and replaces just the background color
			      attributes with current value.

		Character -   Prompts for  a  keyboard  character  or special
			      function set symbol (see ALT-F command).  Solid
			      spaces can  be  used  by  pressing Shift-Space.
			      The screen  is then searched and all characters
			      matching the pattern are replaced with  the new
			      selection.    Color  attributes at any position
			      are not changed, just character values.

		Both       -  Combines  both  the  Attribute   and  Character
			      operations  described  above.    A  replacement
			      character is  prompted for,  then everything on
			      the screen matching the pattern (both character
			      and fore/back attributes) is  replaced with the
			      character and current colors.

	  These commands operate similar to the block action text commands.




       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    84




			  ALT-H: DISPLAY HELP INFORMATION

       The help  screens provide  a quick  reminder for  the various commands
       supported  by  TheDraw.    The  three  screens  briefly  describe most
       available functions.

       The registered  version of  TheDraw supports  context sensitive pop-up
       help for the ENTIRE  program.    Typing  ALT-H  at  any  position will
       display specific help on what you are doing.  Try it, you'll like it!


			       ALT-I: INSERT A LINE

       Inserts a  blank horizontal line at the current position.  The current
       line and all those  below it  are shifted  down.   The bottom  line is
       lost.   The blank line is filled with spaces colored using the default
       background color.  This command can be reversed using the Restore/Undo
       command (ALT-R).


			      ALT-J: ANIMATOR OPTIONS

       The Animator  Options command  operates differently depending on which
       mode you are currently in (normal or animator).


       ALT-J FROM NORMAL/STATIC MODE
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       When in normal mode, selecting ALT-J  will put  TheDraw into animation
       mode.  To convert the existing normal screen images (static images) to
       animation entries, a scan "method" or pattern must be specified.   The
       particular pattern  used tells  TheDraw how to read your static images
       for display.   Scan  patterns  can  be  altered  using  two adjustment
       toggles.  These are:


	  REVERSE   Reverse  entire  scan  pattern.    Last character scanned
		    becomes the first displayed in the animation sequence.

	  FLIP      Vertically exchanges scanning of  the screen  scan top to
		    bottom.   For example  the TOP  scanner below scan across
		    the screen (left to right) starting  on the  bottom line,
		    moving upwards.


       There  are   fourteen  different  generic  scan  methods/patterns  are
       available.  By combining these with the above adjust toggles,  over 50
       patterns are possible.





       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    85




       TOP - Scan Top to Bottom

	  The static  page layers are scanned from their upper-left to lower-
	  right corners.  The scan goes  across the  screen (left  to right).
	  The next line down is then scanned, and so on.


       LEFT - Scan Left to Right

	  Similar  to  TOP,  except  the  scan  goes  down the screen (top to
	  bottom).  The next column over is then scanned, and so on.


       CLOCK - Clock Arm Scan

	  Scans in clockwise direction from center  of screen  to border edge
	  around screen.  Appears somewhat like a growing pie-slice.


       CIRCLES - Circular Ring Scan

	  Scans image  in ever growing circles from center of screen outward.
	  ie:  small circle, then slightly  larger encompassing  circle, then
	  slightly larger again, etc...


       CHECKERBOARD - Checkerboard Effect Scan

	  Scans  alternating  squares  on  first pass creating a checkerboard
	  appearance, then fills in all the gaps on the second pass.


       ANGLE - Angle Scan

	  Scans  each  static  page  layer  from  upper-left  to  lower-right
	  corners, using  a backward angle approach.  ie: scan character then
	  move down to next line and backup one position.

				   AAAAAAAAAA
				   BBBBBBBBB
				   CCCCCCCC
				   DDDDDDD
				   etc...

       GATE - Gated Scan

	  Alternating lines scan from opposite sides  of the  screen forwards
	  and backwards  going across.     The first  line will  scan left to
	  right going across the screen.  The second line scans right to left
	  across the  screen.  The third line scans as the first, etc...  All
	  lines are processed at once, so the screen appears "gated".


       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    86




       PYRAMID - Pyramid Scan

	  Scans in a "pyramid" shape, starting from bottom center of screen.
					.
				       .D.
				      cDCD.
				     tDCBCD.
				    eDCBABCD.

       SQUARES - Squares or Spiral Scan

	  Scans static screen images using squares.  The border of the screen
	  is first  scanned (progressing clockwise).  The next smaller square
	  is then scanned, and so.  Produces a spiral effect.

       SCRAMBLE - Random Scramble Scan

	  Each static page layer is scanned in a completely random order.

       DOOR - Closing Door Scan

	  Screen is scanned from top to  bottom, on  both sides  of screen at
	  once.  Gives the impression of doors closing on the user.

       DIAMOND - Growing Diamond Scan

	  Scans image using ever growing diamond shapes from center of screen
	  outward.  Mildly similar to the circle scan in operation.

       WIGGLE - Wiggle Scan

	  Similar to GATE, except only  one  line  is  processed  at  a time.
	  Produces a  snaking line  appearance starting  from the  top of the
	  screen.  Scan first goes across screen, then returns on  next.  The
	  cycle is then repeated.

       WIGGLEOUT - Wiggle Out Scan

	  Starts in  center of screen with wiggle operation going both up and
	  down at once.


       Once the animation  scan  is  completed,  the  screen  is  cleared and
       redrawn.    At  this  point  TheDraw will operate normally, except all
       entries are sequenced by the animation  system.   Please refer  to the
       section "The Animation System" for more details on its use.

       If you have ideas for more animation scanners, please send them!

       ALT-J FROM ANIMATOR MODE
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Once in animator mode, selecting ALT-J presents several facilities for
       managing the animation system.  The following commands are available:

	  o  Specify Animation Include Files
	  o  Specify User Control Sequences
	  o  Toggle storing of cursor movements
	  o  Convert animation screens to normal mode static screen images
	  o  Rescan current animation screen
	  o  Enter a pause into the animation sequence

       The registered version of TheDraw also supports:

	  o  Animation Position Editing (Sequence Limiting)
	  o  Specify Animation Markers


       INCLUDE - Specify Animation Include File

	  When creating an ANSI  file, TheDraw  allows you  to "include" text
	  from other files in the new one being created.  Ten different files
	  can be included at various  points  in  the  sequence.    These are
	  useful for  the so  called "Ansi  Music" sequences, frequently used
	  images, complex BBS control code  sequences  (for  systems  such as
	  WildCat), etc...    The animation USER-SEQ function following might
	  be more suitable for the latter task however.

	  When TheDraw includes another  file, its  contents are  copied into
	  the new  output file  TheDraw is making.  Once the output Ansi file
	  is created, the include file is not needed again.  The include file
	  need only be present when TheDraw is actually copying text from it.

	  Include files are only accessed  when  TheDraw  is  saving  a file.
	  They are  ignored by  ALT-Q.   If you  wish to  see what everything
	  looks like before saving, use the View option described below.

	  Upon choosing the INCLUDE  option,  a  window  will  appear  on the
	  screen.   All currently defined include files will be listed, along
	  with their positions in the animation sequence.  The following sub-
	  commands are available:

	     SET   - Sets an  include file at the current animation position.
		     In the shareware version of TheDraw, this will always be
		     the end of the current animation sequence.

		     In the registered version, this is the current animation
		     limit position.  This allows include files to  be easily
		     specified  "after  the  fact", anywhere in the animation
		     sequence (see Limit below).



       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    88




	     CLEAR - Erases the include file entry you specify.  No verify is
		     done before the entry is deleted, so be warned.

	     VIEW  - Displays  the   entire  animation   sequence,  with  all
		     specified include  files.   Very useful  for testing the
		     appearance of things.


	  Press [ESC]  once when done editing the include files.  All changes
	  are saved.


	  ANSI MUSIC WITH INCLUDE FILES:

	  Animation include files  are  especially  useful  for  including so
	  called "Ansi  Music" sequences into a TheDraw image.  Ansi Music is
	  not part of the standard Ansi driver.  It is an extension  found in
	  certain modem communication programs (such as Qmodem).  Please note
	  that TheDraw cannot generate Ansi Music source sequences.  The code
	  format of Ansi Music is as follows:

		       <esc>[MF<music control codes><ctrl-N>
			       		       
		       ascii 27 		    ascii 14

	  The section  <music control codes> is a string of music descriptors
	  identical to  those used  in the  Basic PLAY  command.   Refer to a
	  Basic language reference manual for further information.



       USER_SEQ - Specify Animation User Control Sequence

	  Allows you to insert your own short control code sequences directly
	  into the Ansi/Avatar  file  output  TheDraw  generates.   Extremely
	  useful  for  BBS  control  codes  (ie: for user names and such), or
	  inserting special extra Ansi codes into the animation (ie: clearing
	  the  display  midstream,  or  causing  an  image  to scroll).  User
	  Sequences are only referred to when TheDraw saves  a file,  and are
	  not used when redrawing (see ALT-Q).

	  Upon  choosing  the  USER_SEQ  option,  a window will appear on the
	  screen.  All  currently  defined  user  control  sequences  will be
	  listed, along with their positions in the animation sequence.









       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    89




	  The following sub-commands are available:

	     SET   - Sets a  user sequence at the current animation position.
		     In the shareware version of TheDraw, this will always be
		     the  end  of  the  current  animation  sequence.  In the
		     registered version, this is the current  animation limit
		     position.    This  allows  control  codes  to  be easily
		     specified after a screen has been  made, anywhere during
		     the display of the animation sequence (see Limit below).

		     You are  prompted for the user sequence to modify.  Next
		     the sequence must be typed in.  For Ansi escape sequence
		     press the  escape key  (appears as "^["), an open square
		     bracket, followed by the necessary command codes.  ie:

			      <esc>[2J    (will clear the screen)

	     CLEAR - Removes the user sequence entry you specify.   No verify
		     is done before the entry is deleted, so be warned.

	     VIEW  - Displays  the  animation  sequence,  up  to the position
		     where the  specified  user  sequence  is  to  be output.
		     Useful for jogging your memory.



       LIMIT - Specify Animation Limit (registered version only)

	  The  animation  limit  facility  of TheDraw provides for a powerful
	  animation editing system.  You can easily correct mistakes, insert,
	  delete or do anything else in the MIDDLE of any animation sequence.

	  To  use  limiting,  you  tell  TheDraw where to stop displaying the
	  animation sequence.  For  example, assume  you had  a sequence with
	  5000  entries.    You  could  limit  it to 2000, correct a spelling
	  mistake, then quickly reset the limit back to 5000.   With limiting
	  turned on  TheDraw operates  as always, except everything above the
	  animation limit is temporarily held out of the way.

	  Upon choosing the LIMIT option, you can specify the animation limit
	  position by means of the following keys:

	     Up/Down Arrows   Advance/Backup limit by one position.
	     PgUp/PgDn        Advance/Backup limit by 100 positions.
	     Home             Go to start of sequence (position = 0).
	     End	      Go to end of sequence (all entries).

	     marKer           Move to the position of an animation marker.
			      Selecting this command displays a window of all
			      currently  set   animation   markers.     After
			      choosing a marker, the animation limit moves to
			      the position of the marker.   Assuming you have
			      set  markers  in  strategic places, this allows
			      you  to  quickly  bounce  around  an  animation
			      sequence looking for a particular spot.

	  Press  [ENTER]  to  save  the  new animation limit.  Pressing [ESC]
	  leaves the original animation limit position unchanged.



       MARKER - Specify Animation Markers (registered version only)

	  Markers are  used  to  "mark"  different  places  in  the animation
	  sequence for  later reference.   Once  set, markers can be used for
	  changing the animation limit position (see above) and  viewing just
	  portions  of  the  animation  sequence.      They  can be useful in
	  locating things forgotten or set aside until later,  editing images
	  a page at a time, etc...

	  Upon  choosing  the  MARKER  option,  a  window  will appear on the
	  screen.  All currently defined markers are listed, along with their
	  position  in  the  animation  sequence.  The following sub-commands
	  are available:

	     SET   - Sets a marker at the current animation limit position.
		     This allows markers to  be easily  specified anywhere in
		     the animation  sequence.   You are first be prompted for
		     which marker to change.  If  the marker  is already set,
		     it will  be erased before continuing.  After you specify
		     a marker, you can then enter a comment (32 characters).

	     CLEAR - Erases the marker you specify.  No verify is done before
		     the entry is deleted, so be warned.

	     VIEW  - Displays  the  animation  sequence,  up  to  a specified
		     marker.  Useful for  reminding yourself  of what happens
		     early in a 16000 entry animation sequence.

	  Press [ESC] once done editing markers.  All changes are saved.










       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    91




       MOVEMENT - Toggle Storage of Cursor Movements

	  Toggles  whether  or  not  TheDraw  stores  actual movements of the
	  cursor.  Normally only typed characters  are recorded;  however, if
	  the cursor  movement toggle  is on  all movements of the cursor are
	  also stored.  Cursor movements are  being stored  whenever the ANIM
	  symbol in  the status line is flashing.  If you are still in doubt,
	  watch the animation entry count.  It will  increase every  time you
	  move the cursor.


       NORMAL - Convert to Normal Edit Mode.

	  Converts what  appears on  the screen  to normal  mode images.  All
	  animation is erased after  executing this  command.   You are first
	  prompted to verify this before continuing.

	  In  the  registered  version,  anything  not  displayed  because of
	  animation limiting is lost.    Only  what  appears  exactly  on the
	  screen when  you select  this command  is converted  to normal mode
	  images.


       RESCAN - Rescan the Screens

	  Selecting this command prompts  for  an  animation  scan  method as
	  described above  in the ALT-J FROM NORMAL MODE section.  Everything
	  in the animation sequence is first erased, then  the images  on the
	  screens are rescanned.

	  In  the  registered  version,  any animation sequence not displayed
	  because of animation limiting  is  NOT  lost.    It  will  still be
	  available  after  this  operation  is  done.  This differs from the
	  above suboption and permits rebuilding something which did  not cut
	  it the first time.


       PAUSE - Animation Pausing

	  Allows  for  the  putting  of  pauses  into the animation sequence.
	  TheDraw can wait for either a  key press  or a  specified number of
	  seconds.   There is  no limit on pauses and they may occur anywhere
	  in  the  animation  sequence.      This  can  be  very   useful  in
	  presentations.

	  After selecting PAUSE, the following sub-commands are available:

	     TIME_PAUSE       Creates  a  pause  for  a  specified  number of
			      seconds (the pause can  be aborted  by pressing
			      any  key  when  actually  displayed).   You are
			      prompted for the number of seconds to delay.


       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    92




	     KEY_ONLY_PAUSE   Creates a pause for a key to be pressed.

	     CLEAR            Erases  pauses  from  the  animation  sequence.
			      TheDraw  searches  backwards  from  the current
			      animation position for  a  Pause.    If  one is
			      found, you  can DELETE,  VIEW up to this pause,
			      or scan for the  NEXT  pause  before  this one.
			      Press [ESC] to abort clearing a pause.

	  Pauses are observed whenever you redraw the animation sequence with
	  ALT-Q.  When you save an ANSI file, it is  not possible  to produce
	  the exact  pause equivalent (pauses for a key are impossible).  For
	  this reason,  a  small  separate  presentation  program  (THEPP) is
	  included  with   registered  copies   of  TheDraw.    This  program
	  duplicates the operation of the  ALT-Q  command,  and  uses THEDRAW
	  format data files.  See section entitled "The Presentation Program"
	  for information on using THEPP.



			       ALT-K: DELETE A FILE

       Deletes a specified file from disk.  Use this option  to free  up disk
       space when  the need  arises.   The directory file selector (see ALT-L
       below) displays everything in  the current  directory.   Use the arrow
       keys to select a file to delete, or simply type in the filename at the
       bottom of the screen.  Press [ENTER] to select the file.

       TheDraw will then check for the file.  If it exists, you  are prompted
       to  verify  before  continuing.    This is your last chance before you
       delete something you might regret later.



			   ALT-L: LOAD SCREEN FROM DISK

       This command allows you to load any ANSI  text, ANSI  Animation, ASCII
       text,  AVATAR  text,  PCBOARD  text,  WILDCAT text, BINARY dump, Basic
       BSAVE, TheDraw Object, TheDraw COM, TheDraw TD format file, or TheDraw
       Library file.

       You are  prompted to continue if the current screen image has not been
       saved.  The directory  file selector  next displays  all files  in the
       current directory for convenience.  The selector cursor may be used to
       choose a file, or a filename can  be  typed  in  directly.    Move the
       selector cursor  via the  arrow and  PgUp/PgDn keys.   To see the pick
       list of last 10 files accessed, press the TAB key.   Press  [ENTER] to
       load the file.

       If there  are many  files in the directory, a wildcard filename can be
       used to display a partial listing  of  those  available.     Wildcards
       operate  as  found  in  Dos.    Please  refer  to  your Dos manual for
       additional information.  Wildcards are normally temporary, and are not
       maintained between  directory invocations.   They can be made "sticky"
       however by use of the Setup utility.

       If you type in  the  filename,  a  file  extension  is  assumed unless
       otherwise specified.   The  assumed value  is ".ANS" unless changed in
       the setup  options.   The following  file types  require the specified
       extensions for TheDraw to be able to load them:

	     Avatar     	   .AVT
	     PCBoard    	   .PCB
	     Wildcat    	   .BBS
	     Binary Dump	   .BIN
	     Basic BSAVE	   .BSV
	     TheDraw COM File      .COM
	     TheDraw OBJ File      .OBJ
	     TheDraw Format        .TD
	     TheDraw Library File  .TDL

       (Note:   The above filename extensions can be changed in Setup Options
       menu with TheDraw, or via the Setup Utility Defaults option).

       A file without one of  the  above  is  assumed  to  be  an  ANSI file.
       Assembler, Pascal,  and C  format files  cannot be reloaded, except as
       Ascii text.  You  must  keep  another  copy  of  those  screens safely
       somewhere in one of the above loadable formats.

       When loading  Ansi, Ascii,  Avatar, PCBoard, or Wildcat files only the
       first screen is stored.  Any  extra lines  are discarded.   Do  not be
       alarmed by  Ansi files which might be hundreds (or thousands) of lines
       long.  So long as the  cursor  never  goes  below  the  bottom  of the
       screen, everything will load properly.

       Ansi  animation   is  automatically  detected  by  TheDraw  using  the
       following advanced system:  If the cursor suddenly moves to a place it
       normally could never go, the file must be animated.


       AVATAR/PCBOARD/WILDCAT:

       These formats are pseudo-text files.  They load similar to Ansi files,
       but  because   the  control   patterns  differ   TheDraw  selects  the
       appropriate routines based on the extension.

       BINARY/BSAVE/COM/OBJECT/THEDRAW:

       These formats  may contain  either a full screen or small block image.
       Where a block is displayed depends upon the  file format.   Binary and
       Object formats  load in the upper-left corner.  Formatting information
       is not stored with binary blocks however, so  TheDraw will  prompt for
       block width before loading.

       BSave and  COM formats load in the same locations they were originally
       saved from.  The TheDraw format is more flexible however,  placing you
       automatically into block copy/move mode to position the block.


       THEDRAW LIBRARY FILES:

       These  are  an  extension  to  TheDraw TD files, permitting many to be
       stored together.   Comments  may  be  added  to  provide  a  quick and
       efficient  reference.    System  administrators or BBS operators could
       place all screens into a library for convenient reference when updates
       are necessary.

       Since multiple  images are stored per library file, attempting to load
       one presents  the user  with a  directory.   Choose an  entry from the
       directory with  the up/down  arrows and  press [ENTER] to load a file.
       Typing [ESC] will abort the load.



			      ALT-M: SELECT DRAW MODE

       TheDraw supports the "drawing" of lines.   This  is easily  done using
       the arrow  keys while in Draw mode.   The characters used in the lines
       are those available via  the function  keys from  the current function
       key set.  Only the first four sets of characters contain lines.   If a
       function key set without lines  is  selected,  the  first  set (single
       lines) is  used.   Draw mode  is indicated  by the  word "Draw" at the
       bottom of the screen.

       In draw mode, everything  operates without  change.   Typed characters
       still appear.     The only change is that using the arrow keys makes a
       line appear in the direction moved.

				   ALT-N: RULER

       The Ruler command places a pair of intersecting  lines on  the screen.
       The point  of intersection  represents the position of the cursor.  It
       is useful for lining up rows or columns of text or figures.

       The ruler can be  moved using  all normal  cursor keys  (ie: the arrow
       keys, Tab,  PgUp, PgDn, Home, End, etc...).  Press [ENTER] to save the
       new cursor location, or press [ESC]  to return  to the  initial cursor
       position.

       The ruler  can held  on the  screen during normal editing by selecting
       [S]ticky mode.  The  ruler will  appear under  the current  layer.  To
       turn off the sticky ruler, simply select ALT-N again then press [ESC].



			 ALT-O: CHANGE DRIVE/SUB DIRECTORY

       This command  allows you  to change  the Dos default directory or path
       (displayed when loading or  viewing a  file).   All sub-directories of
       the  current  path  are  displayed  for  you.   A new directory can be
       selected by using the arrows keys  or typing  in the  pathname.  Press
       [ENTER] to change to it.  Note that the details of sub-directories are
       not covered here.  Please refer to your dos manual for that.

       For example, if you were on  drive C  in a  sub-directory named GAMES,
       you could  switch to  the subdirectory  UTILITY of drive D by entering
       "D:\UTILITY".  You could then  get  back  to  the  directory  GAMES by
       simply entering "C:" (no backslash).


			    Alt-P:  PAINT/FILL COMMANDS

       This command allows enclosed areas to be easily filled with characters
       and/or attributes.  An enclosed area  is  made  by  using  lines (from
       function key  sets 1-4) or using the Draw command (see ALT-M).  To use
       this command, position the cursor inside the area then press ALT-P.

       The following sub-commands are available:

	 ATTRIBUTE   Changes all  foreground and  background color attributes
		     within the  enclosed area  to those  values shown in the
		     status line.

	 FORE        Changes only the foreground color attributes  within the
		     enclosed area to the current foreground value.

	 BACK        Changes only  the background color attributes within the
		     enclosed area to the current background value.



       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    96



	 CHARACTER   Prompts for a keyboard character or special function set
		     symbol (see ALT-F command).  Solid spaces can be used by
		     pressing Shift-Space.  All enclosed characters  are then
		     overwritten  using  whatever  was  specified.   No color
		     attributes are changed, just actual character symbols.

	 BOTH        Combines  both  the   Attribute   and   Character  paint
		     operations  above.    A  character is prompted for, then
		     everything  in  the  area  is  overwritten   using  that
		     character  with  the  current  color attributes from the
		     status line.

       In animation mode, the Character and Both options  add new  entries to
       the  animation  sequence;  nothing  is deleted.  The Attribute command
       however only changes the color attributes of characters already in the
       animation sequence.  No new entries are added.



		   ALT-Q (normal mode): AT-CODES QUICK REFERENCE

       Shows a  window containing  the AT-Code  commands used  by the PCBoard
       and Wildcat bulletin board systems.  Some examples of AT-codes are:

		       @CLS@   @NODE@   @USER@   @LASTCALL@

       Use arrows keys or mouse to  scroll, and  press [ENTER]  to place your
       choice in the edit screen.  The current color attributes are used when
       drawing.  This effect  when used  in the  BBS will  be to  display the
       appropriate item in the displayed color.

       Note:   The codes  are put down simply as normal text.  TheDraw has no
       awareness of  these codes  beyond the  quick reference  chart.  Mixing
       colors  within  a  code  will  not  affect TheDraw, but will adversely
       affect your bulletin boards ability to interpret the codes properly.


		       ALT-Q (animation mode): REDRAW SCREEN

       This command redraws the animation sequence on the screen.   With this
       you can  see how  your work  is developing.   You are prompted for the
       display speed to redraw at.  Available speeds are from  0 (fastest) to
       255 (crawl).   A  value of  about 40 is generally a good speed to view
       at.  Be warned that 255 literally is a crawl speed, displaying between
       two and  four characters  per second  (standard PC/XT).  A slow redraw
       can be broken out of by pressing any key.

       AUTOREPEAT OPTION:

       Typing "A" will turn  on autorepeat  redraw.   The animation sequences
       will be repeated over and over until a key is pressed.

			    ALT-R: RESTORE/UNDO CHANGES

       Restores from  unwanted or  unintended screen  changes.  This function
       can undo block or global  changes,  clear  or  load  screens,  line or
       column insert or deletes, animation mode toggles, font entry, mistakes
       made to the current line, etc...

       In regards to current line changes,  such modifications  are permanent
       once you move to a new line.



			    ALT-S: SAVE SCREEN TO DISK

       The  Save  Screen  command  offers  many formats for saving the entire
       current screen.   If you do not require the  full screen,  use a block
       save (see  ALT-B).   These can  be more  effective at  times.  Another
       option is turning off excess  blank  lines  using  the  defaults setup
       (refer to pull down OPTIONS menu).

       The  available  formats  are:   Ansi, Ascii, Avatar, PCBoard, Wildcat,
       Binary, BSave, Com, Asm, C, Pascal, Object, TheDraw  Data, and TheDraw
       Library.   Please note  that all color attributes are lost in an Ascii
       file.  All other formats store the complete screen with  color (unless
       overridden).

       You are  first prompted for which storage format to use.  In animation
       mode, only ANSI, AVATAR, and THEDRAW formats are available.  The items
       on the menu are discussed below.


       ANSI - Ansi text file

	  You are first asked what initial screen preparation you want before
	  the image is displayed.  Options are:

		CLEAR - Clear the screen
		HOME  - Move cursor to the upper-left corner of screen
		NONE  - Leave the screen and cursor position as is.

	  The next prompt is for the maximum length of each line in the saved
	  file.   TheDraw can  generate over  1300 characters  per video line
	  (if every character  had  a  differing  color  combination).   Some
	  applications  (such  as  some  bulletin  boards  and  text editors)
	  cannot handle  so many  characters per  line.   Limiting the output
	  line length  sacrifices display  time for  compatibility with these
	  applications.  If length is no problem, specify [N]ONE for the most
	  efficient file.






       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	    98




	  Lastly, you  are prompted for the Ansi display speed (a number from
	  0 to 100).  The operation is similar  to the  ALT-Q animator redraw
	  screen function.   Things are slowed down by adding redundant codes
	  after displayed characters.

	     NOTE:  No exact equation relates the slowdown speed to animation
	     redraw speed.  Display is intimately tied to the computer speed,
	     and how the file  ultimately is  displayed.   A program included
	     with the  registered version  (BAUDSIM) simulates  the effect of
	     displaying a file over  a modem.   BBS  operators can  find this
	     valuable  in  gauging  screens  beforehand.   Experimenting will
	     find the best speed for your needs.


       ASCII - Ascii Text (no colors)

	  Selecting ASCII, you are  prompted  to  continue  with  a non-color
	  image.   The Ascii file produced is similar to any file produced by
	  a normal text editor (ie: Dos  EDIT, Brief,  Turbo Pascal/C  IDE or
	  Sidekick editors).

	  There is  one difference  in the  approach used by TheDraw however.
	  Lines of  Ascii fully  80 characters  wide, are  normally NOT ended
	  with carriage return sequences (CR/LF).

	  Such Ascii  files viewed  via the Dos TYPE command display properly
	  but do not load correctly into most other software.   Therefore, an
	  option  to  force  CR/LF  was  added  to  the Setup Default Options
	  configuration (see pulldown OPTIONS menu).  Set this  toggle if you
	  are having difficulties.


       AVATAR - Avatar Type 0 Text

	  TheDraw produces  an AVT/0 type file.  These are compliant with all
	  needs for reproducing animation.  There  are two  prompts presented
	  after selecting this format, similar to those used by Ansi files.

	  The first  is identical  to Ansi; initial screen preparation.  This
	  controls what happens before the images is displayed.  Choices are:

		CLEAR - Clear the screen
		HOME  - Move cursor to the upper-left corner of screen
		NONE  - Leave the screen and cursor position as is.

	  The second  prompt is  for display  speed slowdown  (ironic in that
	  Avatar was  devised as  a technique  to draw color text faster than
	  Ansi).  This is a number  from 0  to 100  enabling you  to slow how
	  fast the  Avatar file  is drawn.   Things are slowed down by adding
	  redundant control codes into the display.

       AT-Codes / PCBoard / Wildcat BBS

	  The main save prompt lists "@-codes" as a  file type,  then prompts
	  for the  PCBoard or  Wildcat variation.  These are so close to each
	  other both are covered together.

	  Like the Avatar format above, there  are two  parameter options for
	  video preparation  and display speed.  The first prompt only offers
	  Clear Screen or None.   TheDraw  AT-Code files  do not  provide for
	  cursor control, and thus the cursor Home option is not provided.

	  The AT-Code format was devised to simplify the system operators job
	  in create screens.  Only one need be  created, and  the BBS filters
	  out  color  codes  for  users  not  wanting  Ansi  graphics.  It is
	  unfortunate the authors did not consider the ease at which a simple
	  Ansi filter could have been created.

	  TheDraw contains  a convenient  quick reference of most PCBoard and
	  WildCat BBS macro codes (such as @CLS@, @USER@, @LASTCALL@).  These
	  can be  also typed manually onto the screen.  No special processing
	  is done with these codes beyond the reference  screen.   The actual
	  field lengths  of some macros might affect your screen display, and
	  should be compensated for.

	  The color combinations of  Black-on-Black (code  $00), and Blinking
	  White-on-Lightgray (code  $FF) are  not permitted by PCBoard and/or
	  Wildcat.  These are  translated into  Lightgray-on-Black (code $0F)
	  and  White-on-Lightgray   (code  $7F)  accordingly  by  TheDraw  as
	  appropriate.


       BINARY - Binary Screen Dump

	  Produces a straight data byte dump of the video screen.   This data
	  format is  generic.   It is useful for many things, such as loading
	  screen images directly to video ram,  etc...    This  will  be 4000
	  bytes for a standard 80x25 screen; larger for EGA/VGA displays.


       BSAVE - Basic BSave Screen Dump

	  This  file  is  identical  to  a binary screen dump, except loading
	  codes for Basic are placed at the front.  These files can be loaded
	  from basic with:

		      DEF SEG = &HB800 : BLOAD"filespec.BSV"

	  If you have a monochrome monitor, replace the B800 with B000 in the
	  above line.  BSAVE files are always saved to the full screen width.
	  Block saves are limited by this restriction also.



       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	   100




       COM - Dos Executable COM Files.

	  Produces a truly separate program executable from Dos by typing the
	  program name.  COM  files are  useful in  batch files  and the like
	  for -fast-  displaying.  COM file screen blocks (via ALT-B) display
	  only  the  block  without  changing  anything  else.     You  could
	  conceivably generate a "layering" windows effect if you so desired.
	  TheDraw has  three different  styles of  COM file,  and selects the
	  most appropriate to minimize file size.


       ASM - Assembly Language

	  ASM  produces  a  list  of  DB  data statements for use by assembly
	  language  programmers.    Additional  suboptions  are  available to
	  specify  the  assembler  data  format.   You can specify to Crunch,
	  output only Ascii characters, or generate a normal file.  Crunching
	  uses a  custom technique  for compressing color changes and strings
	  of identical characters to make the smallest possible file.

	     Note:  To display a crunched  file you  must use  the uncruncher
	     routine included  (file UNCRUNCH.ASM).   This  file has comments
	     explaining its use.  It is compatible with  Microsoft (MASM) and
	     Borland  (TASM)  assemblers.    Simple formatting changes may be
	     required for other vendors assemblers.

	  The Ascii format saves  only characters  on the  screen.   No color
	  attribute  information  is  stored.    The  Normal format is a pure
	  binary dump of the screen,  converted  to  an  assembler compatible
	  format.

	  You are also prompted for a reference identifier to use.  This will
	  be the  name used  to access  the data  within a  program.  TheDraw
	  takes this  and generates  statements to simplify programming.  For
	  instance, assume a standard full screen with the default IMAGEDATA:

		IMAGEDATA_WIDTH EQU 80
		IMAGEDATA_DEPTH EQU 25
		IMAGEDATA_LENGTH EQU 4000
		IMAGEDATA LABEL BYTE
		     ... data for screen image follows here ...

	  The width and depth statements reflect  the character  dimension of
	  the image  saved.  Saving a block changes them appropriately.  This
	  facilitates easier program development.  Instead of directly coding
	  block sizes  refer to  the above identifiers.  Thus eliminating the
	  need to remember arbitrary  block sizes  and the  dreaded so called
	  "magic numbers".

       PASCAL - Turbo Pascal Compatible Screen Dump

	  This operates  the same  as the  ASM option described above, except
	  the output is in a Turbo  Pascal compatible  CONST structure.   See
	  Appendix B for the section entitled "Programmers Programming Tips".
	  To use the Crunched file format, use the file UNCRUNCH.PAS.


       C Language - C Formatted Compatible Screen Dump

	  Again, this  operates the  same as  the ASM  option.  The format is
	  standard predefined  C array  of type  char.   Crunched screens are
	  handled  using   routines  in   the  two   files  UNCRUN_N.OBJ  and
	  UNCRUN_F.OBJ (for near and  far  code  models  respectfully).   The
	  header file UNCRUNCH.H contains instructions on their proper usage.
	  In short, depending on the code model use select (near or far), the
	  corresponding object must be linked with your program.


       OBJECT - Intel Compatible Object Code File

	  This  is  a  file  format  compatible with many high level language
	  compilers.  Object files  can be  produced with  screen information
	  crunched, ascii  only, or  binary normal  (as in ASM format).  Four
	  code/data models are supported:

				 Turbo Pascal v4.0 (and above)
				 QuickBasic v4.0 (and above)
				 Small Data
				 Large Data

	  The TP40 format is compatible with Turbo Pascal  v4.0 through v7.0,
	  and Borland  Pascal v7.0.   Data saved to these files is referenced
	  by external procedure calls and  pointers.    Refer  to  the topics
	  "TURBO PASCAL v4.0 through v5.5" and "TURBO PASCAL VERSION 6.0/7.0"
	  in the Programmers Programming Tips section for examples.

	  The QB40 format is for use  with QuickBasic  v4.0 and  higher.  The
	  image data  saved to these files are referenced by provided display
	  routines.  The  object  files  are  linkable  (if  you  use  the BC
	  compiler),  or  can  be  incorporated  into a Quick Library for use
	  within the  QuickBasic environment.   When  linking separately, you
	  must include  the file QBUTIL.LIB in addition to any TheDraw object
	  files.  To simplify  matters,  you  can  merge  the  QBUTIL.LIB and
	  object files into one library.

	  A batch  file MAKEQLB.BAT  is provided  to create the Quick Library
	  and separate  library files  easily.   To use,  the first parameter
	  should be the name of the quick library to create.

	  The following parameters are TheDraw object files plus other object
	  (.OBJ) and library (.LIB) files you want included.  ie:

		       MAKEQLB testlib IMAGE1.OBJ IMAGE2.OBJ

	  This creates the files named TESTLIB.LIB and TESTLIB.QLB.   Note no
	  file  extension  was  specified  on  the "testlib" parameter above,
	  since the  batch file  adds ".LIB"  and ".QLB"  automatically.  The
	  Quick Library contains the display routines (from QBUTIL.LIB, which
	  is always added by the  batch  file),  plus  the  screen  images in
	  IMAGE1.OBJ  and  IMAGE2.OBJ.    See the topic "MICROSOFT QUICKBASIC
	  v4.0 AND v4.5" in  the  Programmers  Programming  Tips  section for
	  examples on usage.


	  OBJECT FILE DATA FORMATS:

	  The data formats use the following identifiers:

				 Small Data        Large Data
				 컴컴컴컴컴      컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
		     Segment:      _DATA	  filename_DATA
		     Group:        DGROUP         filename_DATA

	  Where "filename" is the actual filename given the object file.

	  The  last  prompt  under  object  files  is  for the data reference
	  identifier.  This is the name  you  will  use  in  your  program to
	  access the  object data.   It  defaults to  IMAGEDATA (for TP40 and
	  QuickBasic) or _IMAGEDATA (Small or Large Data).  The underscore is
	  usually  required   for  small   or  large  data  formats,  but  is
	  application and compiler dependent.

	  The above identifier is used to  directly reference  the image data
	  stored.      In   addition,   TheDraw  generates  three  additional
	  identifiers similar to the ASM case:

	    <identname>_WIDTH   <identname>_DEPTH   <identname>_LENGTH

	  For QuickBasic users the following identifiers are used,  called as
	  subroutine functions to obtain the wanted value:

	      <identname>WIDTH   <identname>DEPTH   <identname>LENGTH

	  In all  cases, these  contain the dimensions of the block specified
	  (width and depth).  The last identifier specifies how long the data
	  block is.   The  width/depth values  are useful for drawing windows
	  and other related functions.   The  length parameter  is useful for
	  displaying crunched images.

       THEDRAW Data File - TheDraw Setup Save

	  This  format  saves  everything  about the current configuration of
	  TheDraw.  In normal edit mode, all occupied page layers  are saved.
	  In animation  mode, the complete animation sequence is stored.  All
	  other parameters are saved  also  (ie:  current  colors,  tab line,
	  cursor position, current page layer, etc...).

	  The TheDraw  format file  also has the benefit of being the fastest
	  way to load and retrieve screen images; eight page layers  or 16000
	  animation entries take only seconds to load.


       THEDRAW Library File - Group Management of TheDraw Setup Saves

	  Very similar  to TheDraw  Data files, this extension permits saving
	  many screens  in one  file.   A description  can be  added for each
	  entry, and  information on the screen size and type (normal, block,
	  or animated) is also stored.   After entering  a filename  as shown
	  below, the screen switches to a directory of the specified library.

	  Once  in  the  directory,  selecting  the  last entry adds onto the
	  library.  Choosing an  existing entry  replaces it.   Press [ENTER]
	  and the entry is updated.  Press [ESC] to abort.

	     Note:    For  maximum  file  security,  a  temporary copy of the
	     library is kept while  updates are  made.   You therefore should
	     have  enough  disk  space  available  for  an entire copy of the
	     library before attempting to save.

	  An example of the library entry selection window is shown below:

       TYPING IN THE FILENAME:

       Following the above prompts, TheDraw asks  for  a  filename.    If the
       file already  exists, you  are prompted to verify the save.  If you do
       not specify a filename extension, TheDraw assumes the following:

			  .ANS     ANSI compatible files
			  .ASC     ASCII text files
			  .AVT     Avatar Type 0 compatible
			  .PCB     PCBoard BBS
			  .BBS     Wildcat BBS
			  .BIN     Binary dumps
			  .BSV     Bsave files
			  .COM     Dos COM executable files
			  .ASM     Assembler source code files
			  .PAS     Pascal source code files
			  .H       C source code files
			  .OBJ     Object files
			  .TD      TheDraw Data files.
			  .TDL     TheDraw Library files.

       A file without an extension can  be specified  by placing  a period as
       the last character of the filename (ie: TESTFILE. ).  After entry of a
       valid filename, the screen is saved to disk.

       For information and suggestions on using  the screen  files created by
       TheDraw in your programs, see section PROGRAMMERS PROGRAMMING TIPS.



				 ALT-T: TAB SETUP

       This command allows you to set tabs in the editor (positions where the
       [TAB] key stops).  Initially the positions are at every  tenth column.
       Available sub-commands are:

	  SET       - Set a  new tab position.  Move the cursor to the wanted
		      position then press 'S'.
	  CLEAR     - Clears tab at current cursor position
	  RESET     - Resets tab line to initial settings (every ten spaces).
	  ERASE     - Delete all current tab setting for a clean slate.
	  INCREMENT - Prompts for a  step  size.    From  the  current cursor
		      position, every  nth location is then set.  This allows
		      you to  quickly specify,  say every  fourth position if
		      your need requires it.

       Press [ESC] to leave the tab set command.

			  ALT-U: USE COLORS UNDER CURSOR

       Changes current  edit colors  (seen on status line) to those currently
       under the cursor.   This provides  a fast  method to  change to colors
       already displayed on the screen.  See also Pick Character (ALT-/).


			       ALT-V: VIEW A SCREEN

       This command allows you to look at an image saved on disk.  Nothing is
       altered by this command.  This might be  used in  conjunction with the
       block load/import function (see ALT-B).

       Viewing a  screen is  similar to loading (see ALT-L) except the loaded
       image is not remembered.  Once the image is fully  displayed, a window
       appears  with  instructions.      Press  [ENTER]  to  exit  view mode.
       Pressing any other key  will make  the window  disappear to facilitate
       viewing.  After about 30 seconds it reappears to remind you about view
       mode (in case you leave the computer unattended).


			       ALT-W: EDIT CHARACTER
			(available in animation mode only)

       Allows the editing of a mistyped animation entry.  This command exists
       because simply  overwriting an incorrect character does not delete it.
       In  animation  mode,  both  entries  are  remembered  -  the incorrect
       character,  plus  the  wanted  one.    Upon redisplaying the animation
       sequence (see ALT-Q), both  characters would  be seen  (the former for
       only a millisecond perhaps, but it would appear).

       Another way  is using ALT-Z to delete the incorrect entry.  The wanted
       character could then be typed in.  This works perfectly well, and some
       people may  prefer it;  however, to  quickly change  an entry ALT-W is
       more convenient.

       After pressing Alt-W you are prompted to type the new  character.  The
       current  position  will  flicker.    All  color  changing commands are
       available (ALT-A and the Ctrl-Arrow keys) while editing.


				ALT-X: EXIT THEDRAW

       Prompts if you wish  to  exit  TheDraw  or  execute  a  shell  to DOS.
       Responding Yes exits the program.  No cancels the command.

       Shell  also  exits  to  Dos,  however  TheDraw remains in memory.  All
       screen page layers and  animation entries  are retained.   To  free up
       memory for the Dos Shell, TheDraw will try temporarily saving its data
       to expanded memory/EMS  or  a  disk  swap  file  (if  insufficient EMS
       exists).    Typing  the  command  "EXIT" at the Dos prompt will return
       control to TheDraw.

			    ALT-Y: DELETE CURRENT LINE

       Deletes the current horizontal line on  the screen.   All  lines below
       are shifted  up one  line position.   The bottom line is cleared using
       spaces and the default background color.   This  command is reversible
       using the Restore/Undo command (ALT-R).



			   ALT-Z: ERASE CURSOR CHARACTER
			(available in animation mode only)

       Erases  the  top-most  character  from  the  animation sequence at the
       current cursor position.  Only the last character typed at  the cursor
       position is deleted, everything typed before is unchanged.

       This  differs  from  the  Backspace  key which deletes everything at a
       cursor position.



		     ALT-/: PICK CHARACTER FOR MANUAL PAINTING

       TheDraw offers easy manual painting support.  Similar to line drawing,
       you draw  or paint  using a specific "picked" character.  This command
       toggles manual painting, using the character currently under cursor.

       Manual paint mode is indicated by a "x"  structure in  the status line
       (where 'x' is the symbol chosen).  You draw with the symbol by via the
       Shift Arrow-Key combinations.  ie:

				 Shift Up-Arrow
				 Shift Right-Arrow
				      etc...

       To turn off manual paint mode, you must pick the same character again.
       If  painting  with  an  "*",  you  must  type ALT-/ when the cursor is
       resting on a "*" symbol.

       There are other ways of picking characters.   These are  via the Quick
       Palette  and  the  color  shading  screen (in the registered version).
       Using the Quick Palette is very easy with  a mouse.   Simply  click on
       the wanted character is it immediately becomes the picked character.
       The color shading screen sets the picked character to "", "", or ""
       depending on the shading selected.

			 ALT-[LEFT]: DELETE CURRENT COLUMN

       Deletes the  current column on the screen.  Everything to the right of
       the current column is  shifted  over  one  position.    The right-most
       column is cleared using the default background color.  This command is
       equivalent to a Block  Delete (ALT-B,D)  on the  current column.   The
       action is reversible using Restore/Undo (ALT-R).



			   ALT-[RIGHT]: INSERT A COLUMN

       Inserts a  blank vertical column at the current position, filled using
       the default background color.  The current column and all those to its
       right are  shifted over.  The right-most column is lost.  This command
       is reversible using the Restore/Undo command (ALT-R).



			   ALT-- TOGGLE COLOR DRAW MODE

       Toggles color attribute drawing.   In  this  mode,  moving  the cursor
       updates the  new character  position to the current edit colors.  This
       permits easy manual color painting of  a  given  area.    In animation
       mode, only  those locations  with characters in the animation sequence
       will be altered.  Unused locations will not be affected.

       Operation of TheDraw is not changed by this  mode.   Moving the cursor
       will simply change colors.



			   ALT-= TOGGLE MACRO LEARN MODE
			     (registered version only)

       Activates the  macro learning  mode of TheDrawR.  You are prompted for
       which macro key to program (0-9).  After specifying the macro, TheDraw
       remembers everything  you type.   This  is somewhat  akin to animation
       mode; however, macro learn mode literally  remembers everything.   All
       editing commands  performed, any  characters typed,  etc...  Up to 512
       characters will be recorded.

       Once satisfied with the macro, type ALT-= again  to save  it.   To use
       the macro,  press ALT  followed by  the proper  number key 0 through 9
       (do not use the numbers on the keypad).

       While programming a macro,  selecting  another  macro  chains  the two
       together.    Chaining  a macro  in this  fashion permits you to create
       longer macros than available otherwise.   When you  specify the second
       macro, the one being programmed is saved and learn mode is turned off.



       TheDraw v4.63         TheDraw Command Functions  	   108




       To program  the second macro (and continue the sequence), select Alt-=
       from command mode again.

       You can create an "endless" macro quite easily.   Simply  have a macro
       call itself.  For instance, if programming macro 0, type ALT-0.  ie:

		ALT-= 0 [Enter] 	Start programming macro 0.
		<macro contents>
		Alt-0

       TheDraw would repeat the macro contents until ESC was pressed.



			      MANUAL PAINTING OPTIONS

       The manual  painting is  done using  the shift-arrow key combinations.
       For instance:
				 Shift Up-Arrow
				 Shift Right-Arrow
				      etc...

       Selecting a character to paint with  is done  with the  Pick Character
       command (ALT-/),  then choosing  a symbol  from the Quick Palette (see
       pulldown menus), or the color shading  screen found  in the registered
       version (ALT-A,A).

       To turn  off manual  paint mode, simply pick the same character again.



			  ALTERNATE COLOR CHANGE OPTIONS

       For the experienced user,  TheDraw provides  a more  convenient way of
       adjusting the current status line colors.

       Pressing Ctrl-Up increments the current foreground color number (found
       in ALT-A) and Ctrl-Down decrements it.  These two key  combinations do
       not always  work reliably  on all  computers (a Bios flaw exists).  To
       get around this, TheDraw incorporates  a  special  keyboard  driver to
       handle these  two keys.   If  they do not work on your machine run the
       SETUP utility and use "Keyboard  Customize"  to  configure  TheDraw to
       your keyboard.

       Pressing  Ctrl-Right  increments  the current background color number;
       Ctrl-Left decrements it.

			SHIFT-SPACE: SOLID SPACE CHARACTER

       As stated elsewhere in this documentation (see ALT-E), the sprite mode
       of TheDraw  makes lower  page layers  appear through "black spaces" on
       the  current  page  layer.    This  can  sometimes  be  convenient and
       sometimes  not.    There  are  instances  when you want to have a non-
       transparent black space on the screen.

       The Solid Space performs this function  (non-transparent black space).
       Moving the  cursor onto  a solid space will cause the background color
       to flicker as an  indicator.   A Solid  space is  nothing more  than a
       character #255 (which is a blank IBM extended character).



			CTRL-PRTSC: FULL SCREEN MODE TOGGLE

       This command  toggles screen  usage in TheDraw between normal and full
       screen.  In full-screen  mode the  status line  disappears so  you can
       fully  use  the  screen.    Also,  TheDraw  makes  heavy use of pop up
       windows for prompts and  messages.   While useful,  it can  be awkward
       since YOU  must remember  where you  are at  all times.  For instance,
       block marking and etc...  It is easy to become confused unless you are
       careful.   If all else fails, hit ESC a few times to abort the current
       command.  Some people  may prefer  this mode  which is  fine.  Nothing
       forces you to use either way.

       TheDraw will  automatically scroll  the video  as necessary, even with
       the status line on.   Full  screen mode  is generally  used to  take a
       complete look at your work.

       Ctrl-PrtSc only operates from command mode.  It is not available under
       any sub commands (such  as  Block,  Global,  etc...).    There  are no
       restrictions on full screen use in animation modes.

				  THE FONT EDITOR


       TheDraw has  complete support  for Ascii class fonts.  These fonts are
       letters and symbols drawn using the IBM extended character set.  ie:

			     旼컴커   旼컴컴    複複
			             旼    幡  賞
			     쳐컴캑    읕    白複蔔   etc...
			             旼    幡賽賞
				      읕 읕       

       TDFonts is  the management  utility for  adding and  updating the font
       database.  The utility was designed to be straightforward to learn.

       There are  two types  of fonts supported by TDFonts and TheDraw: Block
       and Outline formatted.  Block fonts are very  simple and  nothing more
       than recorded  shapes you  enter.   Outline fonts  are special in that
       they can appear using one  of  17  different  styles  (see  "The FONTS
       Menu").   Included with  TheDraw, the fonts "Outline" and "BigOutline"
       are examples of this type.  Some examples of the styles are:

			  旼컴컴     旼컴컴    幡賽賽
			                          
			                          
			  읕컴컴     突袴袴    賽賽賽

       The choice of formatting types is made when creating a font.  The Font
       Editor (described later) is used to prepare and update the symbols.


       RUNNING TDFONTS
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       To start TDFonts, type from the dos prompt:

	  TDFONTS

       Press [ENTER]  to run  the program.   By default the program looks for
       the database file TDFONTS.TDF in the current directory.  To edit other
       files, list the filename as show:

	  TDFONTS MYFONTS.TDF      (loads MYFONTS.TDF instead of default)

       Keep in  mind only  TDFONTS.TDF is actually used by TheDraw.  You must
       either import  your fonts  into the  file TDFONTS.TDF,  or rename your
       file to TDFONTS.TDF.







       TheDraw v4.63    	  The Font Editor       	   111




       The database is loaded and the font names listed on the screen.  ie:

	  A: Outline
	  B: BigOutline
	  C: Raster
	  D: Rounded

       Naturally the actual list will vary depending on how the data file has
       been manipulated.  Along  the bottom  of the  screen are  all the edit
       commands.    These  are  for  viewing,  changing,  creating new fonts,
       importing and exporting fonts, etc...


       VIEWING FONTS
       컴컴컴컴컴컴
       This command is for  seeing exactly  how a  given font  symbol appears
       when used in TheDraw.  Any special formatting information is hidden.

       Select [V]iew  from the main menu.  Next, pick a font to display using
       either the up/down arrows keys or by typing the letter associated with
       the wanted font.  Press [ENTER] to continue, or [ESC] to return to the
       main menu.

       Pressing [ENTER] brings up the font symbol selector bar.  ie:

		  !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO
		  PQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~

       The first character "!" is  highlighted,  and  the  corresponding font
       symbol appears  below the  selector bar.   Choose different symbols to
       view with the  arrow  keys.    For  undefined  symbols,  the following
       message "Symbol not defined" is shown.

       Just above  the command  bar is  a note  about the font spacing.  This
       number tells how many spaces are inserted between font symbols as they
       are typed  onto TheDraw's edit screen.  In most cases this number will
       either be zero or one.

       When done viewing font symbols, press [ESC] for the main menu.



       CHANGING A FONT
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       The change command allows modifying or  adding symbols  to an existing
       font.  To create a font, use the [N]ew command.

       Select [C]hange  from the  main menu, and pick a font using either the
       up/down arrows keys  or  by  typing  the  letter  associated  with the
       wanted font.   Press  [ENTER] to  continue.  Pressing [ESC] returns to
       the main menu.


       TheDraw v4.63    	  The Font Editor       	   112




       Once a font has been selected,  a screen  similar to  the View command
       appears.  Additional options are available however:

	  [ENTER]     Select symbol for editing (or creating if undefined).
	  [DEL]       Delete current symbol
	  [INS]       Copy current symbol
	  [TAB]       Change font spacing

       These  four  commands  in  combination with the font editor (described
       below) give good flexibility in maintaining the symbol database.


       EDITING SYMBOLS:

	  Transfers symbol definition to the font editor.  The font editor is
	  similar to  TheDraw in many respects, supporting a useful subset of
	  functions.  Some familiarity  with TheDraw  is assumed.   Available
	  editor commands are:

		   [ALT-A]    Change Colors (Color-Block fonts only)
		   [ALT-C]    Clear Screen
		   [ALT-F]    Function key symbol table
		   [ALT-H]    Help Screen
		   [ALT-I]    Insert a blank line
		   [ALT-M]    Toggle line drawing mode
		   [ALT-X]    Leave font editor, saving changes.
		   [ALT-Y]    Delete current line
		     [INS]    Toggle insert mode
		     [DEL]    Delete character under cursor.
		     [ESC]    Leave font editor, discarding changes.
	     [SHIFT-SPACE]    Enter a solid space (a "" symbol)

	  All function  key sets  are identical  to TheDraw  and are selected
	  using the same keystrokes:  ALT-F1 to F10, and CTRL-F1 to F5.

	  EDIT MODES:

	  There are two  main  differences  between  editing  in  TheDraw and
	  TDFonts.    These  refer  to  the  special  edit modes and reserved
	  characters.  The edit  modes are  for the  three font  format types
	  (Outline, Block, and Color Block).

	  Outline  formatted  fonts  place  restrictions  on  the  characters
	  composing each symbol.   You  can  only  use  certain  line drawing
	  characters  from  function  key  sets  1  to  4.  In addition, some
	  symbols must used in specific places  for the  variable outlines to
	  work properly.

	  Block fonts  are simple text graphics.  No extra processing is done
	  either by TDFonts or TheDraw.   The current color  attribute in use
	  by TheDraw is used to color these type of fonts.


       TheDraw v4.63    	  The Font Editor       	   113



	  Color Block  type fonts  are complete mini-text graphics containing
	  both character and color.   The  colors  used  when  creating color
	  block  fonts  are  the  ones  which  will  appear on TheDraw's edit
	  screen.  Color Block fonts override the current colors of TheDraw.


	  EDITING OUTLINE TYPE FONTS:

	  All outline symbols are made from  vertical columns  and horizontal
	  beams.  The "T" below is a classic example.  The double lines which
	  give the 3D effect tell TDFonts  about the  left/right column sides
	  and top/bottom of beams.

		郞袴袴袴袴袴袴
		 靈컴컴컴컴      郞敲	 Horizontal Beam
		 훤袴 郞袴        	   郞袴袴袴袴
		읕컴   靈컴       	   읕컴컴컴컴
		                  
		                   <컴 Vertical Beam
		     훤          읕캭
		    읕컴컴

	  Pay special  attention to  how the top/right of the outside border,
	  and the bottom/left of the inside border were done.   Of particular
	  importance are  the corners.  The following characters must be used
	  in the described locations.

	  For outside borders:
		     Upper-left outer corner
		     Upper-right outer corner
		     Lower-left outer corner
		     Lower-right outer corner
		     Up-to-Right inner corner
		     Right-to-Down inner corner

	  For inside borders:
		     Upper-left inner corner
		     Upper-right inner corner
		     Lower-left inner corner
		     Lower-right inner corner
		     Up-to-Right outer corner
		     Right-to-Down outer corner


	  In general the drawing rules are:

	     Double lines are always the rightmost side of a column.
	     Double lines are always the topmost side of a beam.

	  You must  follow  the  guidelines  exactly  in  order  to  create a
	  functional  outline  formatted  font.    Failing  to do so produces
	  undesirable side effects when changing the outlines in TheDraw.

	  RESERVED CHARACTERS:

	  The reserved characters are for  solid  spaces  and  descender line
	  markers.   Typically solid  spaces are  used to  fill the inside of
	  columns and beams.  These are drawn with "" characters.  ie:

			      郞袴袴袴敲  郞袴袴袴敲
			      놘判判判兌  놘判判判兌      Note that solid
			      놘統컴웍兌  놘擇袴몹兌      spaces are always
			      놘宅袴업兌  놘兌  놘兌      visible in TDFonts
			      놘判判判兌  놘洞컴鵡兌        editor verses the
			      놘統컴웍兌  놘判判判兌      TheDraw editor).
			      읕캭  읕캭  읕컴커判笭
					       읕캭&

	  TheDraw specially  tracks descenders so to align symbols and handle
	  carriage returns properly.  A carriage return should  move the same
	  number of  lines for  either A's or Q's for instance.  If decenders
	  were not marked, following kind of alignment error occurs:

				   複複   幡賽
				            
				   幡賽   賽賞

	  Symbols demanding descenders should be marked as shown in the above
	  "Q"  symbol.    Lines  marked  with ampersands are not counted when
	  TheDraw aligns the symbols.   Font  symbols  typically  needing the
	  descender marks are:

				$ , ; _ Q g j p q y

	  Others symbols may require them also, depending on how your font is
	  designed or implemented.


       DELETE SYMBOL:

	  Removes the database definition for the specified symbol.   You are
	  asked to  verify this  command before  continuing.  Once deleted, a
	  font symbol cannot be restored.


       COPY SYMBOL:

	  Copies current symbol over  to another  undefined symbol.   You are
	  asked  to  specify  what  the  target  symbol is.  Note: The target
	  symbol cannot be defined.  The prevents overwriting  definitions by
	  accident.    This  option  is  of particular use in duplicating the
	  letters symbols (ie:  "A" to "a", "B" to "b", etc...), assuming you
	  intend uppercase  and lowercase  to appear  the same.  This command
	  permits quickly filling out all the definitions.

       CHANGE FONT SPACING:

	  This command changes the  number  of  spaces  TheDraw  puts between
	  typed symbols.   Typically  values are zero or one, but is entirely
	  dependent on the font being managed.  Legal values are 0 to 40.



       MAKING NEW FONTS
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Creating a new font is a simple two part process.   First  make a font
       slot with  the [N]ew  command.  Next, use the [C]hange command to fill
       in all the font symbol definitions.

       After choosing [N]ew, TDFonts asks  for  three  items  of information.
       The first is a descriptive name for the font.  This will appear in the
       font listing, and in TheDraw.  Names can be up to 12 characters.

       Once a name is  picked (which  can be  changed later),  you select the
       font  formatting  type.    Choices  are [B]lock, [O]utline, or [C]olor
       Block.    Refer  to  "EDIT  MODES"  above  for  a  description  of the
       difference.   Briefly, fonts of type Block can be drawn using anything
       but remain fixed.  As you drawn, they will appear in TheDraw.  Outline
       fonts  can  be  altered  on  the fly using the "Outline Type" pulldown
       command.  Color Block fonts are  similar to  the normal  Block variety
       but also save color attributes.

       You have  now generated  a new font slot.  Proceed to use the [C]hange
       command to define  the  individual  font  symbols.    One  approach to
       simplify the  procedure is  making a generic symbol such as "O" first.
       Copy it to other similar symbols (such as "0", "Q", "G", "C", etc...).
       Only minor edits are needed to finish the first symbols.  Use parts of
       these to make other symbols, such as "(", ")", and carry onwards.

       Keep in mind nothing requires you to place letters into  a font.   You
       could create a font holding several often used patterns or pictures.

       If you  create a  font you  are particularly proud of, please consider
       sending in to TheSoft for inclusion  in the  next release  of TheDraw.
       All authors of such donated fonts will be duly noted.


       MOVING A FONT
       컴컴컴컴컴컴
       This command  reorders the  list of  font names.  Use it to place your
       fonts in alphabetical or any order which you prefer.

       Press [M], then choose a font (see View command).   Next, TDFonts asks
       the destination  to put  it.  The font is placed in front of whichever
       destination font you pick.

       RENAMING A FONT
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Changes font descriptions which appear in the main menu list.   Select
       [R]ename and  choose a  font.   You are then prompted for the new font
       name.  Press [ENTER] when done or [ESC] to abort.


       DELETING A FONT
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Permanently removes a font  from the  database file.   Press  [D] then
       choose the  target font.   TDFonts  asks you to verify this operation.
       Be careful since deleting a  font  cannot  be  undone.    Type  [Y] to
       proceed with erasing the font or [N] to abort.



       FONT IMPORTING
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Appends  a  separate  database  file  onto the current database file.
       Press [I], and TDFonts prompts for a filename.   Type  in the pathname
       to the  import file.   Press [ENTER] to continue or [ESC] to abort the
       command.

       Upon pressing [ENTER] all fonts contained in the specified import file
       are loaded  and added  to the current database list.  An error message
       appears if the file was invalid.



       FONT EXPORTING
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Copies fonts in the current database to another file.   Press [E], and
       choose  the  font  to  export/copy.    TDFonts  prompts for the output
       filename.  Enter your filename and press [ENTER] to continue  or [ESC]
       to abort.

       After hitting  [ENTER], TDFonts  checks to  see if  the file specified
       already exists.  If so, type [Y] to overwrite the existing file or [N]
       to abort this command.

       The new font file is generated and you return to the main menu.

			THE SCREEN CAPTURE/GRABBER UTILITY

       The screen  grabber utility  (THEGRAB) is  a small  and very flexible,
       providing many features not found in similar programs.   The following
       features are available:

	  o  Flexible "hot" keys.
	  o  A hands-off screen snap shot mode.
	  o  A hands-off interval screen capture mode.
	  o  Choice of four file formats: Ansi, Ascii, COM, or THEDRAW
	  o  Up to 10000 screens can be captured at any given time.

       THEGRAB  is  driven  from  the  command line, and is a memory resident
       utility (a so called TSR by  technical types).   Once  loaded, it uses
       only 11k  of memory.   Any parameter you set can be changed on the fly
       at any time.  THEGRAB can also be removed from memory easily.

       Please note:   THEGRAB is designed to only handle text screens  - just
		      like  TheDraw.    Attempts  to  capture high resolution
		      graphics are ignored by THEGRAB.

       General users will love  being able  to capture  any screen,  from any
       bulletin board  or online services, edit them with TheDraw then upload
       back.  The single and interval  modes can  capture screens  even under
       programs locking out normal keyboard functions.  Documentation writers
       can capture application screens as Ascii, and load them into  any word
       processor or output to any printer.

       The command line options are:

	 /UNLOAD	  Unload/Remove THEGRAB from memory (when possible)
	 /RESET 	  Change file count back to zero.
	 /KEY [choices]   Capture  key  when  the  specified  key sequence is
			  pressed.      Keystroke   sequences   can   be  any
			  combination of:  LSHIFT, RSHIFT, ALT, CTRL
	 /SINGLE [time]   Make a single snap shot capture after the specified
			  time period has elapsed.   Time  entered can  be of
			  the formats:
			      ss	Seconds
			      mm:ss     Minutes and seconds
			      hh:mm:ss  Hours, minutes, and seconds.
	 /INTERVAL [time] Similar  to  SINGLE,  but repeatedly captures every
			  time interval as specified.
	 /DIR [path]      Specify where captures screens  are saved.   Saving
			  to a ram disk for instance for maximum speed.
	 /ANSI  	  Create standard Ansi files.
	 /ASCII 	  Create Ascii text files.
	 /COM   	  Create Dos executable COM files.
	 /THEDRAW         Create TheDraw format .TD data files.

       USING THEGRAB
       컴컴컴컴컴컴
       First  load  THEGRAB  into  memory,  along with any command line shown
       above.  The default  configuration is  the hot  key [CTRL RIGHT-SHIFT]
       saving to  THEDRAW format  data files.   If  you prefer some other key
       combination, use the /KEY parameter (once  THEGRAB is  loaded, the hot
       keys can be changed anytime).

       THEGRAB uses  certain sound  effects to indicate success or failure to
       save a screen.  Success is indicated by a short single beep.   Failure
       to save  (disk not  ready or  disk full  usually) by  three beeps.  On
       occasion the operating system will be busy, and not permit  THEGRAB to
       save screens.   During  these times several short bleeps of increasing
       frequency will occur.

       If you need to capture a screen from  a program  which takes  over the
       keyboard  (thus  disabling  the  hot  keys),  try  single  or interval
       captures.  Most  applications  which  take  over  the  keyboard rarely
       affect the timer clock.  Start THEGRAB with a suitable delay, run your
       application up to the proper point then wait for the beep.

       Capture as many screens as you want, then quit the  target application
       back to  Dos.   Remove THEGRAB  with the /UNLOAD parameter.  This will
       free up the memory being consumed.

       USING THE GRABBED SCREENS
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       By default screens are saved  to  the  directory  THEGRAB  was started
       from, unless  the /DIR  parameter was  used.  The filenames are of the
       format GRAB0000.ext, where <ext> is .ANS .ASC .COM or .TD

       THEGRAB will  not overwrite  any file  with the  same name.   The file
       number is  incremented until an unused filename is found.  The default
       can easily be renamed later at your convenience.

       Ansi files saved from THEGRAB can be viewed  from the  Dos prompt with
       the TYPE  command.   They can  be loaded  into TheDraw  for editing as
       required, or just to resave them for more compact files.   Ascii files
       are compatible  with any text editor or word processor.  COM files can
       be directly used from the Dos  prompt, and  are fully  compatible with
       TheDraw.  Just type in the filename and the screen will appear.

       TD files  are uncompressed  TheDraw format  data files.  Since TheDraw
       has the necessary routines  to significantly  reduce the  size of such
       screens, it is highly recommended you resave them for that purpose.

       Example usage:

	  THEGRAB /KEY LSHIFT RSHIFT CTRL /COM
	    --  Saves a  Dos COM  file whenever  Left Shift,  Right Shift and
		CTRL keys are pressed simultaneously.

			     THE PRESENTATION PROGRAM


       The Presentation Program (THEPP) included with  the registered version
       of  TheDraw  is  a  command  line  driven utility intended to simplify
       displays and demonstrations.  It is flexible and  easy to  use.  THEPP
       can display any file loadable by TheDraw (Ansi, Ascii, Avatar, Binary,
       BSave,  PCBoard,  Wildcat,  Object  and  TheDraw  formats).    As with
       TheDraw, the  filename extensions  tell THEPP what format a given file
       is saved in.  The following  extensions are  used (but  changeable via
       the SETUP utility):

			      Ansi      	 .ANS
			      Avatar    	 .AVT
			      PCBoard   	 .PCB
			      Wildcat   	 .BBS
			      Binary Dump        .BIN
			      Basic BSAVE        .BSV
			      TheDraw COM Files  .COM
			      TheDraw OBJ Files  .OBJ
			      TheDraw Format     .TD

       Any other  file is assumed to be either Ansi or Ascii.  TheDraw format
       files store which page layer was  being edited.   THEPP  displays only
       this page  layer.  If sprite mode was turned on, any page layers below
       the current one will appear also ("under" the current layer).

       THEPP takes as its parameters a  list of  filenames to  display on the
       screen.   This it  will do  as fast and efficiently as possible unless
       otherwise stated (on other  words,  you  will  probably  want  to slow
       things down a bit).

       The  following  options  may  be  interspersed anywhere in the command
       line, before between or after, any  filenames.   Options are specified
       by using a slash followed by one of these characters:

	  Character       Action

	      p 	  Stops THEPP  the display  of pause  messages on the
			  screen.  Note the pauses are still performed.

	      k 	  Pause for a key  to be  pressed by  user.   This is
			  useful for  placing between  files, so you can stop
			  to appreciate what is shown.  See also /i command.

	  Character       Action (continued)

	      t<num>      Pauses for <num> number of seconds.   Valid numbers
			  for <num> are 1 to 255 seconds.  ie:

				   /t10   (pause for ten seconds)

	      s<num>      Animation display speed.  This is a slowdown factor
			  identical to the value you enter  when using ALT-Q.
			  It is  used whenever  THEPP displays a Ansi, Ascii,
			  or TheDraw format file.   ie:  s10  slows  down the
			  file display equivalent to an ALT-Q value of 10.

	      b 	  Produces a beep on the computer speaker.

	      c 	  Clears the  screen.   THEPP by default does nothing
			  before displaying a file.  If you wish to clear the
			  screen beforehand use this option.

	      m<x>,<y>    Moves  the  cursor  to  horizontal position <x> and
			  vertical position  <y>.    Useful  if  you  want to
			  control where  an Ansi  or Ascii file will start to
			  appear on the screen, or wish to display  a message
			  using the command below.  ie:

			     /m40,12   (move cursor to center of screen)

	      a<f>,<b>    Changes   text   output   color  to  the  specified
			  foreground and background colors.   Colors  are the
			  same as listed under ALT-A, but are repeated below:

			      Black     	  DGray     (Dark Gray)
			      Blue      	  LBlue     (Light Blue)
			      Green     	  LGreen    (Light Green)
			      Cyan      	  LCyan     (Light Cyan)
			      Red       	  LRed      (Light Red)
			      Magenta   	  LMagenta  (Light Magenta)
			      Brown     	  Yellow
			      LGray (Light Gray)  White

			  Foreground  colors   may  be   any  of  the  above.
			  Background colors are restricted to the first eight
			  however (Black to LGray).  ie:

			      /aYellow,Cyan  (Yellow on Cyan background)

	  Character       Action (continued)

	      "text"      Displays  any  message  or text between the quotes.
			  The  message  MUST  be   terminated  by   a  quote,
			  otherwise  THEPP  assumes  the  rest of the command
			  line is a message.  This is useful  if you  wish to
			  display your  own "Press any key to continue" style
			  message, etc...  Use the "m" option described above
			  to  position  messages  anywhere on the screen, and
			  "a" option to select appropriate colors.  ie:

					  /"Hello World"

			  Prints  message  "Hello   World"   (without  quotes
			  naturally) at cursor position.

	      v<size>     Specify video  size to  use.   Either 25, 43, or 50
			  vertical  lines.    Note  the  43  &  50 parameters
			  operate identically  (43 lines  always selected for
			  EGA adapter, 50 for VGA).  ie:

				 /v50  (select VGA 50 line display)

	      f<filename> Directs THEPP  to  obtain  more  commands  from the
			  specified file.   This command file simply contains
			  a list of the above  commands.    In  addition, the
			  command  file  may  call upon another command file.
			  Once  that  nested   command   file   is  finished,
			  execution returns  to the  following instruction in
			  the first file.   Up to  ten levels  of nesting may
			  be active at once.  ie:

					   /fCOMMANDS.FIL

			  Use file COMMANDS.FIL as source for next commands.


       If you  do not  give any parameters, THEPP will display an abbreviated
       help screen for convenience.  Examples of THEPP usage and explanations
       are given below:


       THEPP /c/p SHUTTLE2.ANS /m34,25 /aYellow,Black /"Press a key" /k/c

	  Clears the  screen, and  turns off  the display  of pause messages.
	  The Ansi text demo file SHUTTLE2.ANS is displayed,  followed by the
	  message "Press  a key" in Yellow approximately in the center of the
	  bottom line.  THEPP then waits  for  a  key  to  be  pressed before
	  clearing the screen and returning to Dos.

       THEPP DEMO.TD /c /m38,12 /"BLIP" /b/p/t10 /m1,20

	  Displays the current page layer of DEMO.TD, then immediately clears
	  the screen, displays "BLIP" in the middle of the screen, and sounds
	  the speaker.  The cursor is then placed at the beginning of line 20
	  and THEPP exits.


       THEPP SOMEFILE.ASC

	  Displays the contents of the Ascii file SOMEFILE.ASC on the screen.
	  Equivalent to using "TYPE SOMEFILE.ASC".

       THEPP /fCOMMAND1.FIL /m1,6 /"All done!"

	  Makes THEPP  obtain its  next commands  from the file COMMAND1.FIL.
	  This file simply contains a list  of command  line parameters.   An
	  example might be:

	     Filename #1:  COMMAND1.FIL
		/m1,1
		/"Command file 1 running - Running command file 2"
		/fCOMMAND2.FIL
		/m1,3
		/"Command file 1 resumed."
		/m1,4
		/"All done!"

	     Filename #2:  COMMAND2.FIL
		/m1,2
		/"Command file 2 running"

	  In this  example, command files are nest two levels deep.  In other
	  words, COMMAND1.FIL calls COMMAND2.FIL  which  then  exits  back to
	  COMMAND1.FIL.   THEPP allows nesting to go ten (10) levels deep for
	  a large amount of complexity.    Running  the  above  example would
	  produce the output:

	     Command file 1 running - Running command file 2
	     Command file 2 running
	     Command file 1 resumed
	     All done!

	  Note:    Conceivably,  an  semi-endless  loop is possible.  In this
	  case, a command file would call itself (ie:  replace /fCOMMAND2.FIL
	  with /fCOMMAND1.FIL in the above example).  If this occurred, THEPP
	  would open the same command file 10 times  then stop  with an error
	  message.

				 THE SETUP UTILITY


       This  section  describes  how  to  customize  TheDraw and install your
       customizations in the THEDRAW.EXE or THEDRAWR.EXE (registered version)
       files.


       WHY SETUP?
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Setup  is  the  TheDraw  installation  program;  used to customize the
       TheDraw program (.EXE) file.  With this utility you can specify screen
       modes, change  edit colors  and customize  various other defaults.  It
       directly  modifies  various  parameter  values  within  your  copy  of
       THEDRAW.EXE or THEDRAWR.EXE.

       Via Setup you can do the following:

	  o  Setup the default video display mode

	  o  Change screen colors

	  o  Resize TheDraw's usage of available memory

	  o  Change save screen default parameters.

	  o  Specify initial default filespec wildcards.


       In the registered version of TheDraw, the Setup utility can also:

	  o  Customize or "remap" the editor command keys and mouse buttons.

	  o  Setup a path to the directory where help files are stored.


       TheDraw comes ready to run; there is no mandatory installation.  After
       setting up as specified in "GETTING STARTED", TheDraw is usable.

       However, you  will need  to run  Setup if  you want  to do  any of the
       following:

	  o  Change TheDraw default colors.

	  o  Force a display mode or "snow" checking

	  o  Customize the editor commands to preferred sequences.

	  o  Adjust memory usage to better suit your needs.

       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       The  setup  utility  operates  in  a  windowing user environment.  You
       select commands by either pressing the highlighted capital letter of a
       given option,  or using  the Up  and Down  arrow keys  to move to your
       selection and then pressing [ENTER].


       SAVING AND ABORTING CHANGES
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       In general, pressing [ENTER]  will save  any changes.   Pressing [ESC]
       (as many  times as needed) will abort a function and return you from a
       submenu to the main installation menu.  Where  this convention  is not
       followed, instructions are displayed on screen for you.


       RUNNING SETUP
       컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       To get started, from the Dos prompt type:

	  SETUP

       Press [ENTER]  to start  the utility.   Once running, you are prompted
       for the program filename to configure.  You can have several different
       customized copies  of TheDraw on your system.  These various copies of
       THEDRAW.EXE can each have  different executable  program names.   This
       allows you to prepare various editor command-keys, menu colors, etc...
       if you are so inclined.   The  registered  program  version  is called
       THEDRAWR.EXE.

       After  selecting  a  file  to  edit,  SETUP determines what version of
       TheDraw is being updated (shareware or registered).   It then proceeds
       to the main menu.


       THE MAIN MENU:

       The  main  setup  menu  displays  all  the  primary  areas  which  are
       configurable.  Options available  are Editor  configuration*, Keyboard
       customize, Screen  mode, Colors,  Help and  overlay file path*, Memory
       usage, Defaults, or Quit/Save.  These are described below.

       * Available while editing the registered version only.










       TheDraw v4.63    	 The Setup Utility      	   125




       EDITOR CONFIGURATION:

	  The editor in  TheDraw  provides  many  features,  including cursor
	  control,  color  changing,  various  text operations, etc...  These
	  editing commands are assigned  to certain  keystrokes, as described
	  earlier throughout  this documentation.   This setup option permits
	  you to change the default assignments for each function.

	  When you select Editor  Configuration from  SETUP's main  menu, the
	  editor installation  screen appears.   Three columns of information
	  will be immediately notable:

	     o  The  first  (left-most)  column  describes  each configurable
		function available in the editor.

	     o  The second  column lists  Primary keystrokes.  These keys are
		the defaults by which TheDraw normally operates.

	     o  The third  column  lists  Secondary  keystrokes.    These are
		optional  alternates  keystrokes  you  may  press to invoke a
		given  editor  action.      These   keystrokes   always  take
		precedence over the primary keystrokes described above.

	  Along the bottom of the screen is a list of the keys used to select
	  and modify entries.

	     Key	      Action
	     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
	     [UP] [DOWN]      Selects the editor command you wish to change.

	     [PGUP] [PGDN]    Scrolls up/down one full screen page.

	     [ENTER]          Enters the secondary keystroke modify mode.

	     [R]	      Restore all  editor  commands  to  the original
			      default values.

	     [ESC]            Returns to the main SETUP options menu.
	     컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

	  After pressing  [ENTER] to  modify a command, the current secondary
	  definition disappears.  You can then  type in  your new definition.
	  Anything may  be used  for redefining  a key  except Numbers (0-9),
	  Letters (A-Z,a-z), [ENTER], [ESC]  and [BACKSPACE].   A  maximum of
	  four keystrokes  for any  given editor command is allowed; however,
	  certain key  combinations  are  equal  to  two  keystrokes.   These
	  include ALT-(key),  cursor movement keys ([UP], [PGDN], etc...) and
	  any keystroke involving a function key ([F1], [CTRL-F4], etc...).

	  Press [ESC] to  save  any  changes  to  keystrokes.    You  will be
	  prompted  to   verify  the  save.    If  there  are  any  duplicate
	  keystrokes, SETUP will point  out the  first occurrence  so you can
	  clear up the problem (marked with an asterisk).



       KEYBOARD CUSTOMIZE:

	  The true  IBM-PC and certain clones have a Bios omission preventing
	  the [CTRL-UP],  [CTRL-DOWN], [ALT-LEFT]  and [ALT-RIGHT] keystrokes
	  from working  properly.  TheDraw gets around this by using a custom
	  keyboard driver.  The factory defaults  from TheSoft  will work for
	  the great majority of computers.  However, if you have difficulties
	  try this setup configuration option.

	  SETUP examines the keyboard hardware to  see what  happens when any
	  of the  above are  pressed.  Upon selecting this option, the screen
	  clears and prompts if you wish to continue.  Next you are  asked to
	  press  [CTRL-UP],  [CTRL-DOWN],  [ALT-LEFT] and [ALT-RIGHT] in that
	  order.  The scan codes returned by your keyboard are displayed.

	  Next you can experiment  to see  that everything  is indeed working
	  properly.      Press   [CTRL-UP/DOWN]  and  [ALT-LEFT/RIGHT]  until
	  satisfied the keys were programmed  correctly.    Press  [ENTER] to
	  return to the main menu.

	  Note:
	     A few  computers react  badly to  this driver.  If your computer
	     does not operate as expected  when  running  TheDraw,  start the
	     setup utility by typing (from the dos prompt):

		   SETUP *

	     Press  [ENTER]  to  start  Setup.    The current settings of the
	     keyboard driver will be displayed.  Respond [Y]es or [N]o if the
	     setting  is  correct.    If  after  deactivating the driver your
	     computer still malfunctions, please contact TheSoft.



       SCREEN MODE:

	  Normally, THEDRAW will automatically  determine  the  correct video
	  mode of  your computer.   You should only need to change the Screen
	  mode option if:

	     o  you think TheDraw is incorrectly detecting your hardware.

	     o  you have a Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) that does not produce
		the "snow" or hashing effect.


       TheDraw v4.63    	 The Setup Utility      	   127




	     o  You have an EGA or VGA video card and wish to always start in
		43/50 line edit mode.

	     o  your computer has a composite or LCD video  screen, appearing
		like a  CGA but  with only one color.  In this case, you want
		the Black and White screen option.

	  Upon pressing S to select this  option, a  pop-up menu  will appear
	  with the available options.  These are fairly apparent:


	  DEFAULT

	     TheDraw will operate in the mode active when first run.


	  BLACK AND WHITE

	     TheDraw  will  use  composite  black and white mode (80 column),
	     regardless of the active mode  when  first  run.    The original
	     video mode will be selected when you exit TheDraw.


	  COLOR

	     TheDraw will use color mode (80 column), regardless of what mode
	     active when first run.  The original video mode will be selected
	     when you exit TheDraw.


	  EGA/VGA

	     TheDraw  will  use  color  mode  (80  column)  and  43/50 lines,
	     regardless of what mode was  active  initially.    Initial video
	     mode is restored upon exit from TheDraw.


	  MONOCHROME

	     TheDraw  uses  monochrome  video  mode, and switches back to the
	     previous mode upon exiting.

	  After selecting one of the first three options above (Default, B&W,
	  or Color),  SETUP checks  the screen  for snow.  If you see snow or
	  hashing, respond Yes to the prompt that appears.

       COLOR CONFIGURATION:

	  TheDraw holds three complete  sets of  configurable colors.   Which
	  color  set  is  used  depends  on the initial screen mode specified
	  above.  The sets  are for  Color, Black  and White,  and Monochrome
	  screen users.  A pop-up window prompts for which set to edit.

	  After selecting  a color  set, another  pop-up prompts for the item
	  type to configure.  Options are the Edit Screen, Main Help Display,
	  Directory  (Load/View)  Screen,  Pop-up  help,  and  Pull-Down menu
	  display.

	  Next,  a  menu  of  configurable  items  under  that  type appears.
	  Selecting one  displays a  view port and list of available colors.
	  The view port shows an example of the  screen item  you chose.   It
	  also reflects any changes in colors as you scroll through the color
	  palette.

	  Use the arrows keys to select  a  color  to  your  liking  from the
	  palette.   Watch the  view port  to see  how the item looks in that
	  color.  Press [ENTER] or [ESC] to save your choice.

	  Now repeat this procedure for every screen color  item you  want to
	  customize.   When done,  press [ESC]  until you  return to the main
	  SETUP menu.



       FILES DIRECTORY:

	  The Files  Directory is  used by  TheDraw to  find its  files.  The
	  shareware version looks for the pick list file (THEDRAW.PCK) there.
	  The registered version of TheDraw looks for its help and  macro key
	  files there in addition.

	  The current  setting is  displayed for  you.   To change it, simply
	  type in the new directory.  Enter a period (.) by itself to use the
	  current directory  of Dos  when TheDraw  is loaded.   Press [ENTER]
	  without entry to leave unchanged.

       MEMORY USAGE:

	  TheDraw always tries to allocate all available memory  up to limits
	  specified by this SETUP option.  When fully configured, TheDraw can
	  use as much as 410k of  memory.    Memory  is  allocated  first for
	  screen page layers and then for the animation system.

	  If you  have limited  memory, there might not be enough space for 8
	  page layers and 16000 animation entries (maximum usage).  There may
	  however  be  enough  space  for  4  page  layers and 5000 animation
	  entries, or just one layer, or anything in between.

	  This  is  when  you  may  wish  to  override  the  automatic memory
	  allocation.   To make  TheDraw operate  as in earlier versions, you
	  would want just 2 page layers  and  5000  entries.    Feel  free to
	  experiment.  Keep in mind that TheDraw will scale down all settings
	  when loaded if there is insufficient memory.

	  Upon selecting this option the current  settings are  displayed for
	  you.   The amount  of memory occupied by screen page layers and the
	  animation system is also  indicated.   If you  wish to  change them
	  answer Yes to the prompt.  You can then enter new values for both.



       DEFAULTS:

	  TheDraw  has  certain  default  values used throughout the program.
	  Some of these are:

	     o  Initial edit colors
	     o  Default file extensions
	     o  Default file save parameters
	     o  Sticky directory wildcards
	     o  Initial work file directory
	     etc...

	  Selecting Defaults from the main setup menu displays  a screen with
	  several fields.  Use the up and down arrow keys to select the field
	  you wish to change.  PgUp/PgDn  switches between  the three screens
	  of options.   To  change a  value follow  the on screen directions.
	  Pressing [R] at any  time restores  all "factory"  defaults.  Press
	  [ESC] when satisfied with your changes.

	  Note: Many  of the defaults may be changed using TheDraw's internal
	  Setup screen also.

       QUIT/SAVE:

	  Once all changes are completed, select Quit/save at  the main SETUP
	  menu.  The message:

				Save Changes? (Y/N)

	  appears along  the bottom  line of  the screen.  Reply Yes, and all
	  the changes you have made will  be saved  into TheDraw.   Reply No,
	  and all  your changes  are ignored.  After either reply, you return
	  to the dos prompt.

	  If you ever decide to reset TheDraw completely to factory defaults,
	  simply copy  the EXE  program file from your original disk (you did
	  make one right?) onto your work  disk.    If  you  -just-  want the
	  editor commands restored, type [R] under the editor configuration.

				    APPENDIX A

			       SETTING UP CONFIG.SYS


       The ANSI  driver must  be installed  to display  Ansi color images and
       Ansi animation files via the Dos TYPE command.   This  can be  done by
       adding a  'DEVICE=ANSI.SYS' statement to your CONFIG.SYS file.  If you
       do not have a CONFIG.SYS  file,  you  can  create  one  by  typing the
       following in your root directory:

			  COPY CON CONFIG.SYS<enter>
			  DEVICE=ANSI.SYS<enter>
			  ^Z<enter>     	  ( <-- press CTRL and Z )

       If you have a CONFIG.SYS file, append the sequence with:

			  EDLIN CONFIG.SYS<enter>
			  #I<enter>
			  DEVICE=ANSI.SYS<enter>
			  ^Z<enter>     	  ( <-- press CTRL and Z )
			  E<enter>

       For this  to work properly, the ANSI.SYS file must also be in the root
       directory of your boot disk or hard drive (whichever is applicable).

       People wanting  to use  a mouse  with TheDraw  may have  to install an
       additional  file  in  their  CONFIG.SYS  file.    If  a driver must be
       installed, follow the above instructions using the name  of your mouse
       driver  (ie:  MSMOUSE.SYS  or  MOUSE.SYS, etc...) instead of ANSI.SYS.
       Additional parameters  may be  required.   Please refer  to the manual
       that came with your mouse for more details.

       There  are  many  other  useful  statements that can be placed in your
       CONFIG.SYS file.  Two which can  dramatically improve  the performance
       of DOS are:

				     BUFFERS=10
				     FILES=10

       Add these  as stated  above.   If you created a new CONFIG.SYS for the
       DEVICE=ANSI.SYS clause by COPY CON, then append these using the second
       method.  Enjoy!

				    APPENDIX C

			    COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

       In  an  attempt  to  help  users  with  commonplace difficulties, this
       section answers some of the more frequent questions.

       Q:   When saving a full screen  Ansi  file,  TheDraw  reports  it used
	    only 3 or 4 lines.  Did something go wrong?

       A:   No.   The number  TheDraw reports  is the number of output lines.
	    This is the number  of lines,  for instance,  used when uploading
	    such an  Ansi screen  to a  BBS system.  TheDraw normally puts as
	    much information onto a given output  text line  as possible.   A
	    number of  the Ansi  screen lines might be placed onto one output
	    line; however, the file will display as expected.
       ----
       Q:   Why does TheDraw display  garbage when  I load  captured graphics
	    screens?

       A:   TheDraw is  not designed  to handle  high resolution graphics per
	    say.  TheDraw handles only text images.  It is similar to  a word
	    processor in that regard.
       ----
       Q:   How can TheDraw support imbedded Ansi BBS control sequences?

       A:   Previously  users  had  to  resort  to  Animation  Include files,
	    however starting  with TheDraw  v4.0, user  control sequences are
	    directly  supported.    Refer  to command ALT-J,User-Seq for more
	    information.    PCBoard  and  Wildcat  BBS  users  will   find  a
	    convenient quick reference chart handy in normal editing mode.
       ----
       Q:   How can  I control  the location of the cursor after an Ansi file
	    is displayed?

       A:   The easiest way is to  convert  your  Ansi  screen  to Animation.
	    Select the  ALT-J, and  the "Top"  scanner.  The top scanner will
	    make your Ansi file  display as  before.   You could  choose some
	    other if you like.  Next, move the cursor where you would like to
	    appear after the display is finished, and press the [SPACE] bar.

	    The space  will  become  the  last  character  displayed  and the
	    position where TheDraw leaves the cursor.
       ----
       Q:   Can I  use images  created with  this software in my own programs
	    for public use (or sale)?

       A:   Yes.  There are  absolutely no  restrictions on  work you create.
	    You  might  add  a  mention  "Screens  produced  by TheDraw", but
	    TheSoft does not require it.



       TheDraw v4.63    	    Appendix C  		   134



       Q:   How do I upload Ansi files to another computer (a  bulletin board
	    system)?

       A:   Ansi files  are sent  identically to regular text messages, using
	    your communication  programs Ascii  upload option.   Before doing
	    so, be  aware some  BBS's explicitly do not support Ansi.  If you
	    pass the first hurdle, note  some  BBS's  feature  automatic text
	    wrap-around for  lines which are too long.  Other's simply refuse
	    to accept more than a maximum line length.  Either  of the latter
	    cases will disrupt the appearance of your Ansi files.

	    To  avoid  difficulties,  find  the maximum line length enterable
	    before the above problems occur (generally 70 characters is about
	    average).    Next,  when  saving  your  Ansi files using TheDraw,
	    specify the number determined  (70 here)  for the  maximum output
	    line length.   TheDraw will limit lines to that length, and there
	    should be no problems uploading the image.
       ----
       Q:   How do I draw circles/ovals/etc?

       A:   Smooth circles & ovals  are  not  possible  using  text graphics.
	    Approximations are  done with careful selection of characters and
	    symbols.  For instance:
					複複
				     輻    賽
				              
				   死          死
				              
				     霜    複
					賽賽
	    The above was produced using symbols from function key set #6.
       ----
       Q:   I get disk full error messages when I try saving an Ansi  file to
	    an empty  diskette.   The file  is large, very close to the 16000
	    animation limit.  Is this a bug?

       A:   Seems unlikely a bug  exists.    The  Ansi  produced  is probably
	    larger than  your diskette.   Try  splitting it  into two smaller
	    chunks.  Although dependant  primarily  on  the  application, the
	    largest  Ansi  file  we  know  of TheDraw producing was about 7.9
	    million bytes (a test  of  16000  random  entries,  32 char/line,
	    ansi pause of 50).  Even larger files might be possible.
       ----
       Q:   Why can't I change the video size from 25 lines to 43 or 50 lines
	    as the manual suggests?

       A:   You must have an EGA or VGA video card adapter installed in order
	    to  use  these  video  modes.    If  you  have a EGA/VGA card and
	    TheDraw is not recognizing  your  hardware,  then  please contact
	    TheSoft describing the situation.




       TheDraw v4.63    	    Appendix C  		   135



       Q:   How can I combine two Ansi files together?

       A:   There are  three ways.   Either load them both into TheDraw under
	    animation mode (you will be  prompted  if  to  append  the second
	    file), or use the Dos COPY command.  ie:

		      COPY FILE1.ANS+FILE2.ANS FILE3.ANS

	    The  above  will  create  a  new  file "FILE3.ANS" containing the
	    complete contents of FILE1.ANS and FILE2.ANS.

	    The last method involves using a  50  or  100  line  buffer mode,
	    loading each target Ansi file into appropriate portions (an ideal
	    use of Block Load), then saving as one file.
       ----
       Q:   My mouse  will not  go below  line 25  when using  the 43/50 line
	    video mode.   I  can use the cursor keys fine, but the mouse gets
	    stuck.  What is wrong?

       A:   TheDraw requires a mouse  driver  (ie:  MOUSE.SYS,  MOUSE.COM, or
	    similar  variation)  be  installed  which  is compatible with the
	    EGA/VGA video card.   Please contact  your mouse  manufacturer or
	    check local computer bulletin board systems for an update.
       ----
       Q:   Every  so  often  I  get  a  funny  space character on my screen.
	    Moving the  cursor onto  it causes  the cursor  to "flicker" with
	    colors.  Why does that happen?

       A:   You have  come across  what is termed a "Solid-Space".  These are
	    special characters  normally  used  with  TheDraw's  sprite mode.
	    Solid  spaces   are  entered  by  pressing  the  SHIFT-SPACE  key
	    combination.   They are not normal spaces  (character 32),  but a
	    blank special IBM extended space (character 255).  A setup option
	    exists for filtering them from your Ansi/Ascii screen files.
       ----
       Q:   When I  type  saved  ASCII  files,  sometimes  extra  blank lines
	    appear.  What is wrong?

       A:   Your screen  contains lines which are the full screen width.  The
	    cursor is "wrapping" down to the next line thus causing the extra
	    blank  line  to  appear.    Such  Ascii files are compatible with
	    standard  text  editors.    To  make  Ascii  files  which display
	    properly  using  the  Dos  TYPE command, toggle the "Force CR/LF"
	    option in the Setup options screen to "NO".
       ----
       Q:   When I save animated Ansi files,  I  cannot  get  a  character to
	    display in the lower-right corner.  How can I correct this?

       A:   You can't.   The screen scrolls whenever a character is displayed
	    in the lower-right  corner.    This  is  extremely  disruptive to
	    animated Ansi  files.   TheDraw thus  does not output characters,
	    but will however paint the corner with the desired colors.


       TheDraw v4.63    	    Appendix C  		   136




       Q:   I am a BBS system operator and puzzled  by the  Ansi maximum line
	    length parameter.   What  exactly is  this used  for, and does it
	    mean I can't have full screen Ansi images?

       A:   The Ansi maximum  line  length  is  completely  separate  of what
	    appears  on  the  screen.    The  parameter  affects  the  output
	    formatting of Ansi files, but not  the way  they appear onscreen.
	    We  must  make  the  distinction between displayed Ansi lines (as
	    they appear) and output lines (as in the .ANS files).

	    Output lines contains large  amounts  of  cursor  positioning and
	    color control  codes.  A given displayed Ansi line might actually
	    translate to an output line over 1000 characters long.

	    In situations where Ansi files are loaded into other software, or
	    uploaded  to  BBS  systems  as  messages,  physical limits on the
	    output line lengths might be  imposed.    Say,  for  instance, 70
	    characters.   This limits  the maximum amount of Ansi information
	    TheDraw can pack onto  a given  output line.   However,  the Ansi
	    screen display  will not  change at all!  TheDraw will compensate
	    for the  short output  lines by  moving the  cursor and adjusting
	    color codes  as required.  The more TheDraw is forced to do this,
	    the longer and slower your Ansi file becomes.

	    For maximum speed and the smallest  files, use  an Unlimited line
	    length.    BBS  system  operators should use unlimited length for
	    menu screens and the like --  unless  all  Ansi  files  are being
	    stored as  messages.   Your message base might have a line length
	    limit.  If all your BBS does is display text  files however, then
	    use the unlimited line length.

				 REVISION HISTORY


       05/01/86  -  Version 1.00  -  Program completed.
       ____

       05/05/86  -  Version 1.01

       Carl Ehmann noticed a glitch in text creation that caused highlighting
       and blinking attributes  changes  to  go  unnoticed.    This  has been
       corrected.
       ____

       06/05/86  -  Version 1.02

       Steven Mills  discovered a bug in the file loading routine that caused
       TheDraw to flag valid filenames as invalid.  It has been squashed.

       Changed the program to not allow the user to enter a code  #26 or code
       #27 into  a text screen. A code #26 is the Dos end of file marker, and
       entering it means loss of all following text upon displaying  the file
       or reloading  it back  into TheDraw.   A  code #27  is the ANSI driver
       signal  character.  Supposedly  ANSI  ignores  invalid  sequences, but
       allowing  the  code  created  "false"  ANSI codes which caused loading
       problems.
       ____

       07/31/86  -  Version 1.03

       Upon prompting from Carl Ehmann, output line length  limiting has been
       added.   This will  facilitate other  programs which cannot load lines
       conceivably going over 1300 characters (such as RBBS).   Color changes
       can now  be accomplished  using the  Ctrl-Left and Right arrow keys to
       increment the fore and background colors respectively.
       ____

       08/15/86  -  Version 1.10  (later changed to v2.00)

       Changes in a big way.  New features include:
	 ANSI Animation, Line Drawing, Ruler, movement of
	 blocks UNDER other text and much more!!

       Quick color change keys have been expanded to  use the  Ctrl-Up, Down,
       Left, and Right keys in a more logical manner.
       ____

       09/13/86  -  Version 2.01

       A few  more enhancements.   Pop-Up help, and macros have been added to
       the new registered version of the program.  Also a few aspects  of the
       animation editor have been sped up.

			      REVISION HISTORY (cont)


       09/19/86 - Version 2.02

       Fixed a slight bug which was causing TheDraw to display the wrong Help
       Screen (in registered version).  Also,  the registered  version wasn't
       keeping track of where its overlay was.
       ____

       09/27/86 - Version 2.03

       Carl Ehmann noticed yet another glitch (what would I do without him?).
       The Ascii save routine was using ANSI codes  to advance  the cursor to
       the next line.
       ____

       11/28/86 - Version 2.04

       Ray Buti  discovered an  oddity with  the Pascal  screen save.  If you
       used a single quote "'" TheDraw didn't compensate  for it.   Therefore
       when  Turbo  Pascal  compiled  that  screen  it  complained.  Ray also
       noticed that  characters under  #32 were  missing the  "#" required by
       Turbo.  These have both been cured.

       In addition,   the animation load routine has been made more reliable.
       Occasionally movement just involving the  cursor  (no  text)  would be
       lost.   Other improvements  were made  to make  animation screen files
       smaller and display faster.
       ____

       03/06/87 - Version 2.10

       Support for monochrome monitors has finally been added.  Don't ask why
       I never  did it  before...   The glitches  Paul Pacter (and many other
       people) found  with IBM  PC Ctrl-Up/Down  keys has  been eliminated. I
       would have  never noticed  that glitch,  so many thanks!  Kent Godding
       made an excellent suggestion for a ansi-file slow down routine.   This
       has  been  added.    Lastly,  a  few  changes were made to the command
       structure to clarify things and many prompts were cleaned up.

       06/20/87 - Version 2.20

       BSave saves fixed to operate properly  for monochrome  monitors.  Ansi
       files now  output <esc>[40m  color sequences  to clear screen to black
       color before doing anything else.  Thanks to Barry Simon  for bringing
       this  oversight  to  my  attention  and  also  suggesting command line
       filespecs.  Some  new  items  were  added,  most  notably  full screen
       editing.   Thank Ray  Buti for  finally bugging  me enough  to add it.
       Also extended options for Asm, Pascal,  and  new  C  storage  modes to
       crunch and  store only  Ascii in addition to the original normal (4000
       byte) mode.  Thanks to Douglas A. Nicklow for suggesting the C storage
       capacity.
       ____

       08/22/87 - Version 2.21

       Fixed a  minor glitch  with window  sizes being  slightly off.  Also I
       missed a problem in the registered version.  TheDraw was not using the
       overlay path  entered by the Setup utility when initializing.  So much
       for learning  from mistakes  (ie: it  happened before).   In addition,
       using a  command line  filespec sometimes loaded a Ansi or Ascii image
       with a random background color.  Needless to say, everything  has been
       fixed.
       ____

       04/28/88 - Version 3.00

       Many, MANY  changes.   TheDraw totally  rewritten to take advantage of
       Turbo Pascal v4.0.  A new title screen,  dynamic allocation  of screen
       layers and  animation space  (up to 16000 animation entries and 8 page
       layers can now be  used),  multi-layer  Sprite  editing,  dos shelling
       (suggestion from Billy Noto), and a new high-speed TheDraw format data
       file have all been added.    TheDraw  now  incorporates  its  own Ansi
       driver so Ansi/Ascii file loading is much faster.

       The animation  system has  been greatly  expanded.  Five new animation
       scanners have been added (ANGLE, GATE, PYRAMID, SQUARES,  and WIGGLE).
       Animation markers(R),  "include files",  animation pausing, support of
       animation on multiple page  layers (no  longer restricted  to just one
       page), global  animation screen  copies, and more have all been added.
       Animation sequences can now  be  appended  together.    The registered
       version supports easy animation editing.

       A couple  of bugs  were fixed.   The  pascal save left spurious single
       entries on the end of lines (yet another discovery of Ray Buti  :-) ).
       The Ascii Save no longer outputs spaces on the end of every line.

			      REVISION HISTORY (cont)

       (v3.00 cont)

       The  Setup   utility  has   been  vastly  overhauled  and  now  allows
       configuring  of  the  TheDraw  edit  screen  colors,  TheDraw keyboard
       commands(R), and many other parameters.
       ____

       09/09/88 - Version 3.10

       Support for the Microsoft Mouse has been added, making cursor movement
       and the marking of blocks easier.  Five additional character sets have
       been added.   These  are accessed via CTRL-F(1-5).  With this revision
       goes a  new function  key screen  (ALT-F).   Finally, a  few bugs were
       eradicated.   Many people reported CTRL-Up/Down keys were not working.
       They did work, however the status display was not always updated (thus
       causing  the  following  confusion).    TheDraw  now  allows filespecs
       without extensions  to  be  used  again.    In  addition,  the default
       filespec extensions  can be  changed using the Setup utility (Ray Buti
       can now change .PAS to anything he likes  <grin>).   The Setup utility
       Defaults option now works as advertised.  Finally, the keyboard driver
       for Ctrl-Up/Down has been changed yet again.  With the  last revision,
       a few computers were gained but the PCjr was lost.

       04/04/89 - Version 3.20

       Pull down  menu system has been added to TheDraw.  The program can now
       be totally controlled by use of a mouse.   Various  small details that
       escaped detection  regarding the  mouse were corrected.  TheDraw has a
       new storage format -- COM files.  Separate  programs useful  for batch
       files and  the like.  They work with blocks and (naturally) the entire
       screen.  A few bugs floating around the program have been cured.  When
       attempting a  block save, TheDraw would sometimes display and save the
       wrong screen portion.  The ALT-U  command was  not processing blinking
       colors properly  -- thanks  to Darin  May for  pointing this out.  The
       ALT-L file directory had a minor problem when  there were  exactly 124
       items displayed.  You could go down to the next page even though there
       was nothing on it.   Animation  screen copies  might possibly  fail if
       they run out of room.  What the user saw didn't necessarily match what
       TheDraw thought was there until everything  got redrawn.   The problem
       with CTRL-UP/DOWN  simply won't go away.  The driver will work for 99%
       of  machines,  but  certain  computers  with  non-compatible  keyboard
       hardware  will  lockup  (notably  the  Tandy 1000A and HX).  The SETUP
       utility now has a provision for deactivating the driver completely.

       11/01/89 - Version 3.30

       TheDraw format files now support block load/save.   A color attributes
       drawing  mode  has  been  added,  access  via  Alt--.  Thanks to James
       Carroll  for  this  suggestion.    You  can  now   specify  a  default
       directory/wildcard when  using sticky  directory listings.   Thanks to
       Sylvest Adam for this suggestion.   TheDraw supports  a ten  file pick
       list now.   This  maintains a  listing of the last ten files accessed.
       Simply press the TAB whenever TheDraw prompts for a filespec.  TheDraw
       now generates  Intel format  compatible object code files.  Useful for
       linking with Turbo Pascal v4.0 and above, C plus many other high-level
       languages.   The ruler  can now  be made  "sticky".   When active, the
       ruler stays on the screen appearing under the  current page  layer.  A
       few bugs  were fixed.   The  problem with ansi animation files getting
       confused  when  saved  without  screen  preparation  has  been solved.
       Thanks to Terry Blake for reporting it.  Alt-O now properly allows you
       to change  drives.    A  minor  glitch  with  animation  include files
       dropping characters  has been  solved.  Finally, the directory listing
       handles the mouse in a more predictable/controllable manner.
       ____

       03/01/91 - Version 4.00

       A great number of changes, additions, and improvements.  First the bug
       fixes:   Garry Kraemer  found the  uncruncher was not in sync with how
       TheDraw handled flashing characters.    Michael  Harris  discovered it
       was possible  to select  a page  0 in version 3.30.  Paul Furman noted
       BSAVE files  were not  quite compatible  with Basic,  lacking a ending
       sequence.   Carter Downer  noted that 80 column Ansi files produced by
       TheDraw were not fully compatible with bulletin board systems.

       New features are:  EGA/VGA screen  editing (43/50  lines for EGA/VGA).
       A virtual  screen edit  buffer was  added, allowing  screens up to 160
       characters by 50 lines can  be  edited.    Mouse  aided  line drawing;
       pressing the  middle mouse button down and moving will draws a line or
       box.  All cursor keys now function throughout  TheDraw.   Line drawing
       now tolerates bumping into the screen border.  New animation scanners:
       Doors*,  Diamond*,  Circle*,  Clock*,   Checkerboard,  and  Wiggleout.
       Thanks to  Guy StarBuck for suggesting the first four.  The ability to
       reverse any  animation scan  (making the  scan go  backwards) was also
       added.   Thanks to  Dorothy Hade  for this excellent suggestion.  User
       Ctrl sequences permitting BBS operators to install custom Ansi codes.
       The last animation improvement  was the  ability to  append -ANY- file
       format  (except  .TD)  to  an  animation sequence.  For non-ansi/ascii
       files, TheDraw requests an animation scanner to reading the screen.

			      REVISION HISTORY (cont)

       (v4.00 cont)

       Block and global character/attribute  replace  has  been  added.   The
       default load  filename extension can now be changed to something other
       than  ANS.    An  online  setup  menu  was  added  to  TheDraw, making
       configuration of the environment much easier.  Two additional COM file
       formats were added, with TheDraw transparently  selecting the  best of
       the three for a given application.

       Ascii files  can now  be forced to have carriage returns placed on the
       end of each line.  ALT-Key pop-up help screen added.  TheDraw  can now
       save  backup  files.    The  ALT-Left/Right key sequence delete/insert
       columns.  Automatic screen blanking was added.  Dos Shell now attempts
       to swap  out information to EMS memory or a disk swap file to increase
       available memory  during the  shell.   Lastly (whew!),  TheDraw can be
       made  to  prompt  to  save  changes  before exit.  Either just for the
       current page, or for all page layers.
       ____

       03/18/91 - Version 4.01

       A minor correction to the .OBJ  file  format  loader,  the  Last Block
       option works  properly now,  plus a  couple other  minor fixes to bugs
       somehow squirming through testing.   The  presentation program (THEPP)
       now  properly  displays  TheDraw  format  files saved with sprite mode
       turned on.

       03/16/92 - Version 4.50

       Over  50  improvements  and  corrections.  Bug fixes include corrected
       Ansi file generation, improved QuickBasic support,  cleaned up various
       screen  display  quirks  associated  with  the  virtual  edit  buffer,
       problems  with  column  insert/delete,  better  handling  of  switches
       between 25  and 43/50  line buffers,  difficulty with read-only marked
       files, quirks with screen blanking, better  handling of  bell codes in
       Ansi files,  problems with the Sticky ruler not being saved to TheDraw
       format files, glitches with  display refresh  in animation  mode, plus
       several other minor improvements.

       Thanks to:
	  Steven Fischkoff for finding bugs with animation scramble scanner.
	  J. T. Merrill for finding problems with THEPP when displaying
	    animated files.
	  Warren Leadbeatter for pointing out circumstances where unwanted
	    blank lines could get inserted into Ansi files.
	  Jeff Lawson for finding bugs when loading read-only files, saving
	    small  (less   than  512  bytes)  object  files,  and  suggesting
	    improvements for the QuickBasic MAKEQLB batch file.
	  Ian Thurston for supplying a example for the Clipper compiler.
	  Joe Fischer (and others) for helping identify a glitch with Ansi
	    saves relative to spurious linefeeds in the top video line.

       Improvements include  encrypted screen  data to  thwart hack attempts,
       internal Ansi/Ascii font support, true restore/undo facility which can
       reverse any screen operation, a 23 line edit  buffer (very  useful for
       BBS screen  generation), improved cursor viability when foreground and
       background colors are the same, pull  down menus  now display shortcut
       keystrokes, file  listing used  with the load/view/delete function now
       show directories, more efficient Ansi file generation, and mouse users
       can  now  click  on  items  in  the  status  line (when pulldown menus
       displayed) as shortcuts for common commands.  Enjoy!

       04/15/92 - Version 4.51

       Alas...  the  best  laid  plans.    Another  bug  in  the  creation of
       QuickBasic object  files was  found by Gary Deal.  This has been taken
       care of.  An obscure problem  with  background  colors  in  Ansi files
       reported by  Chris Wirth (and others) has been cured.  Lastly, a minor
       hiccup with the sticky ruler only  working  in  sprite  mode  has been
       repaired.

       ----

       02/15/93 - Version 4.60

       Many  overall  improvements.    New  title screen, Added are the Quick
       Palette  (for  choosing  color  &  symbols),  picking  up  symbols and
       manually paint  with it,  a 100  line static  edit buffer, multi-color
       fonts, larger font capacity, animation fade-out, animation auto-repeat
       displaying,  Library  format  files  which permit saving many TD files
       together  along   with  descriptions,   ability  to   view  TD  files,
       compression  in  TD  files,    C  source  code  file  format  now more
       compatible with more compilers, new  file  formats  for  BBS operators

       Wildcat @-code  keywords, optional removal of unused lines when saving
       screens (very useful for  BBS operators),  and for  registered users a
       built in version of the SHADING.TD screen (R).

       Bug fixes  to animation  text centering,  viewing object files, column
       insert/delete (when used with  numeric  keypad  arrows),  Ansi include
       files, Ansi  loader less  likely to spuriously turn on animation mode,
       improved handling  for  "color-bleeding"  with  scrolling  Ansi files,
       fixes to TDFonts, QuickBasic functions adjusted to avoid leaving extra
       data on stack, saving COM files safer when  large edit  buffer in use,
       global screen move works with large edit buffers, cursor not forced to
       left-most column at end of  animation  files  anymore,  can  no longer
       "click" on  status line  items with  mouse if  the status  line is not
       displayed, and the SETUP  utility  now  ignores  shift-key  codes when
       programming the keyboard driver.

       Thanks to:
	 Toby Vander Steen for finding animation text centering bug.
	 Gary Yuen for object file viewing and column insert/delete glitches.
	 Michael Arnett for pointing out the animation include files were
	    less than perfect.
	 Brad Crouch for finding a circumstance in which COM files would not
	    be saved properly.
	 B.J. Freeman for indicating the Setup utility keyboard config bug.
	 Dafyd V. Smith for the 23 line buffer loading problem, and
	    suggesting animation auto-repeating!
	 David P. Hummel & Dafyd V. Smith for suggesting animation fadeout!
	 Abram Miller for suggesting the modified dos prompt in shells.

       03/22/93 - Version 4.61

       Maintenance release.  TheDraw  had a  problem handling  color setup in
       Ansi files with a space in the upper-left corner of the screen.  Other
       minor bugs in the Setup utility, PRINTDOC, and TheGrab were fixed.

       Thanks to:
	 Anthony  Haxton  for  pointing  out  the  Setup  utility  might  not
	    recognize the registered version of TheDraw.
	 Paul  Hirsch  for  finding  one  of  the  items in the Setup utility
	    default section worked backwards (ie: typing "Yes", got "No").

       09/07/93 - Version 4.62

       Maintenance  release.    Problem  with  saving  PCBoard/Wildcat  files
       related  to  background  colors  and scrolling (ie: color wrap-around)
       fixed.  Also repaired minor glitch  in ALT-A  screen when  Numlock was
       turned on  - the  arrow keys  would only increment colors.  Ansi files
       now include a special sequence  which  turns  on  line  wrap-around on
       terminal programs.   This  should cure a number of problems related to
       display of characters in the 80th column.

       Thanks to Luke Rice for reporting how typing an 'A' in the color setup
       (ALT-A) screen might cause a crash.

       10/19/93 - Version 4.63

       Maintenance  release.    A  glitch  which  came and went... came back.
       Blinking colors in Ansi files would not be properly output  if 1) they
       were the  first colors  used and  2) not  on the  first line.  Special
       thanks to  William Zakreski  for reporting  this.   TDFonts would exit
       with the  cursor turned  off in  some situations; this should be fixed
       now.  Thanks to Brian Morin for writing in.

       Avatar, PCBoard, and Wildcat  formats  can  now  optionally  reset the
       display color to light gray on the end of files.  The reset is enabled
       by default, and corresponds to how  Ansi files  are handled.   To turn
       off the  color reset,  choose Setup from the Options pulldown menu, go
       to page 2, and change the "Reset colors..." toggle.   Direct thanks to
       Alan Shoemaker for recommending this one.

       TheDraw  now  handles  @CLS@  Wildcat/PCBoard  commands  properly.  In
       attempting to filter the @CLS@ command  TheDraw adds  itself, all were
       removed.  Lastly, Wildcat/PCBoard slowdown codes are fixed.
